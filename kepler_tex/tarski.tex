\section{Introduction}
\label{tarski:intro}


This is a collection of problems
in geometry.
Each problem can in fact be expressed in 
Tarksi's language of the real numbers.  There are decision
procedures to decide 
the truth of
any statement expressed in Tarski's language.  In this
sense, every problem in this collection is elementary.



\subsection{Flyspeck}

The sphere packing problem asserts that no packing of congruent
balls in three dimensions has density greater than $\pi/\sqrt{18}$.
This density is achieved by various packings, including the
face-centered cubic packing.

A long computer-assisted proof of this theorem appears
in \cite{DCG}.  The aim of an project called {\it Flyspeck} is
to give a complete formalization of this proof of the theorem.
  (The name {\it Flyspeck} comes from the acronym {\it FPK},
for the {\it Formal Proof of the Kepler} conjecture.)

This collection is a contribution to the Flyspeck project.  The problems
in this collection were extracted from the proof of the theorem.   
All of the extracted problems share certain 
features.  They can all be expressed as statements in Tarski's
language of the real numbers.  They are all statements
about the geometry of configurations in three dimensional Euclidean
space.  They can all be expressed with a small number of quantifiers.

\subsection{complexity}

What is meant by a {\it small} number of quantifiers?  Most of
the statements are about configurations of points.  Each point
is described by three coordinates, and hence three quantifiers.
In addition to the quantifiers that specify the coordinates there
may be a few additional quantifiers that specify the internal
relations among points.  For example, many statements assert that
two affine spaces intersect, and this is expressed through existential
quantifiers.
  
The collection is generally
arranged in order of increasing number of points.  This ordering
is not strict, because we have also tried to order the results
according to logical dependence, and to group together results 
that bear an affinity to one another.  The longest section of
the collection deals with five-point configurations.  
There is a smaller group of results about six-point configurations,
and then just a few results that involve seven or eight points.

From the point of view of quantifier elimination over the real
numbers, a configuration
of eight points is a daunting problem.  It involves 24 quantifiers
for the coordinates,  together with the additional
quantifiers tied to the internal relations among the points.



However, these problems are all rather simple from a geometric
point of view.  Eight points, for example, specify the
vertices of two tetrahedra in Euclidean space.    There is only
one result in this collection that concerns eight points, and
it is the assertion that two tetrahedra, subject to various
simple constraints, have disjoint interiors.  It is a completely
trivial
matter to give a direct geometric proof of this result.


\subsection{methods of proof}

Each statement in this collection is accompoanied by a proof.
In keeping with the elementary nature of the statements, 
we have generally tried to restrict our methods of proof to
elementary arguments.  We avoid quoting results from external
sources to make this collection self-contained.

As a rule, we avoid limits, calculus, analysis, and measure theory.
There are rare exceptions, where we look at the sign of derivative in a proof
to determine whether a function is increasing. 
There are a few compactness arguments implicit in some
of the proofs, where we move some of the points in a configuration
until a constraint is satisfied.

Non-elementary functions have been avoided as a rule.  A few
arguments are based on consideration of angle, which are defined
in terms of point configurations by means of an inverse trigonometric
function.  (See Section~\ref{sec:trig}.)  However, as we point
out in that section, the inverse trigonometric functions can be
eliminated from equations that are linear in the angle, by making
suitable use of trigonometric addition formulas.  Thus, the only purpose of
the inverse trigonometric functions is to make the
proofs more legible.

A few results elementary results in \cite{DCG} were established
by computer.  In a few cases, we have retained a computer-assisted
proof.  Each computer-verified inequality carries a nine-digit 
identification
number \calc{123456789} that helps to locate the computer code
that specifies the inequality and that performs the verification.
The identification number is used in the formal statement of the
inequalities.\footnote{\tt
http://flyspeck.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inequalities/kep\_inequalities.ml.}


\subsection{formalization}

Although proofs have been provided for all the results, it is
my hope that other proofs might be found that are better adapted
to formalization.  In the best of all possible
worlds, we might hope for
algorithms that entirely automate the proofs in this collection.
This collection is not altogether different from the large collection
of problems in geometry that have been successfully automated
by Wu's method. 

After all, a quick glance at the problems shows that these are
mostly simple results about incidence in affine geometry, convexity, cones,
and the circumradius.  If such a collection lies beyond
the limits of automation, then this does not bode well for 
the general discipline of automated theorem proving.  That then
is the hope and challenge of this piece of the flyspeck project:
to find algorithms to automate the proofs in this collection.


Some general proof methods have been suggested
in a companion article \cite{MG}.  These proposed methods include
quantifier elimination, energy minimization of tensegrities,
sums-of-squares decompositions, and global optimization.  


\subsection{figures}

Some of the results are accompanied by figures.\footnote{The number $2.51$ appears
throughout this collection.  It appears here, because it appers throughout
the proof of the packing problem.  It would be more natural to
rewrite all of the results so that the constants that appear are
optimal for the given configurations.  This would give
the results in this collection a more natural and definitive
form.  However, this would complicate some of
the proofs.  For that reason the results are left in their
current form.}
 
% Some of these
%figures are called ``stick figures.'' These are highly schematicized
%two dimensional representations of the configurations.
%
%In a stick figure, there is generally one point, called the
%base point.  (As a general rule, it is the point called $v_0$ in
%the statement of the result.) 
%
%The base point does not appear in the stick figure.  Rather, it
%is the point of perspective, from which every other point is viewed.
%More precisely, let $S=\{v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$ be a set of points
%in $\ring{R}^3$.  Assume that there is a plane $P$ that separates
%$v_0$ from all the points $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$.  Then each point
%$v_j$, for $j\ne 0$, gives a segment from $v_j$ to $v_0$ that intersects
%$P$ in a point $\bar v_j$.  The stick figure draws the points
%$\{\bar v_1,\ldots ,\bar v_k\}\subset P$ in the plane $P$.
%A line segment from $v_i$ to $v_j$, with $i,j>0$, is represented by a
%line segment from $\bar v_i$ to $\bar v_j$ in the stick figure.
%A line segment from $v_i$ to $v_0$ degenerates to a single point $\bar v_i$
%in the stick figure.
%
%The stick figures are not drawn to scale.  Rather they give
%a quick and dirty schematic representation of the points of a configuration
%in a way that is represents the primary incidence relations.
%In fact, in general it would be impossible to draw the stick figures
%to scale, because many of the results assert that the given
%configurations do not exist!
%
%A stick figure should be imagined with the viewer located to one
%side of $P$ and the base point $v_0$ to the other side of $P$.  Thus,
%the viewer sits in front of the printed page, and the
%the base point is located {\it behind} it.  With
%this perspective in mind, 
%when a segment $\bar v_i$ to $\bar v_j$ is shown as
%passing over a segment $\bar v_k$ to $\bar v_\ell$, this is intended
%to convey the geometric fact that the segment $v_k$ to $v_\ell$ meets
%the triangular convex hull of the three points $v_i,v_j,v_0$.  That
%is, the viewer perceives the segment $v_i$ to $v_j$ as lying in front
%of the segment $v_k$ to $v_\ell$.
%
%There are certain conventions for representing various length constraints.
%Various segments are constrained to have lengths between $2$ and $2.51$.\footnote{The number $2.51$ appears
%throughout this collection.  It appears here, because it appers throughout
%the proof of the packing problem.  It would be more natural to
%rewrite all of the results so that the constants that appear are
%optimal for the given configurations.  This would give
%the results in this collection a more natural and definitive
%form.  However, I fear that this would complicate some of
%the proofs.  For that reason the results are left in their
%current form.}  When a segment $v_j$ to $v_0$
%has unspecified length the corresponding vertex $\bar v_j$ is represented
%as a black dot.  If $v_j$ to $v_0$ has length between $2$ and $2.51$
%(or thereabouts), then $\bar v_j$ is represented as a unfilled dot.
%If $v_j$ to $v_0$ has length between $2.51$ and $\sqrt8$ (or
%thereabouts), then $\bar v_j$ is represented as a crossed dot.
%
%A segment $v_i$ to $v_j$ in the approximate range $[2,2.51]$ is marked with
%an unfilled segment $\bar v_i$ to $\bar v_j$.  In the approximate
%range $[2.51,\sqrt8]$, the segment $\bar v_i$ to $\bar v_j$ is marked
%with an $X$.  There are no markings on segments of unknown length
%constraints.

\subsection{database}

\subsubsection{tags}

Each problem carries a list of tags to make it easier to search the database for
problems with various properties.

Here is a list of tags and their intended meaning. Many of the intended meanings are a matter
of definitions that appear elsewhere in this collection.

\newenvironment{taglist}{}{}

\begin{taglist}

\marker{inside}{a point insides a region formed by a convex hull, a lune, or a cone.}
\marker{deprecated}{The statement has been deprecated and should not be used in the Flyspeck project.}

\end{taglist}

\subsubsection{summary}

Each problem carries a summary statement. This is not meant to be a faithful statement
of all the hypotheses and conclusion.  It is intended as a label to help identify which
problems might be relevant in a given context.

\subsubsection{rating}

The rating is a rough guess about how difficult the result will be to formalize.   These numbers
are of heuristic value only.  Wiedijk's heuristic
is a week of labor to formalize one-page of textbook mathematics.  A rating of $100$ roughly corresponds
to one page of textbook mathematics.   The total rating of the entire collection is about $14,500$.


\subsubsection{usage}

By extracting various results from the main body of the proof,
there is danger that their original context might be forgotten.
For that reason, many of the results are accompanied by usage
notes that indicate the purpose of the result in relation to \cite{DCG}.

The collection of problems and their proofs are completely independent
of these usage notes.

Similarly, fix the values of all the variables $x_{ij}\ge 0$ except
$x_{34}$ to view $\mu_\Delta(x_{34})=\Delta(x_{ij})$ as a function of $x_{34}$.  % 4th argument
The polynomial $\chi$ has less symmetry that $\rho$ and $\Delta$.  For that
reason, we need to take greater care with $\chi$ about the order in which the variables are
listed as arguments.  Note that the last three arguments of
$\chi$ contain the three variables $x_{ij}$ whose indices $ij$ satisfy $i\ne 1\ne j$.
Also, the $i$th and $(i+3)$rd argument of $\chi$ contain distinct indices.

We write $\Delta_{(ij)}(x_{ij})$ for the partial derivative of $\Delta$
with respect to $x_{ij}$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
To see that the polynomials $\ups$ and $\Delta$ are non-negative and that $R=0$, 
volumes are not required.
Write $w_i=v_i-v_1$, and write out components for $w_2,w_3,w_4,w_5$:
$$
w_2 =(r_1,r_2,r_3),\quad w_3 = (s_1,s_2,s_3),\quad w_4= (t_1,t_2,t_3),
\quad w_5 = (u_1,u_2,u_3).
$$
Set $x_{ij} = w_j\cdot w_j$ if $i=1$ and $x_{ij} = 
w_i\cdot w_i + w_j\cdot w_j - 2 w_i\cdot w_j$, to write $x_{ij}$ as a 
polynomial in the components $r_i,s_i,t_i,u_i$.  We obtain the following
positivity results.
   $$
   0 \le 4((r_2s_3-s_2r_3)^2 + (r_1s_3-s_1r_3)^2 + (r_1s_2-s_1r_2)^2) = 
   \ups(x_{12},x_{13},x_{23}),
   $$
    $$
    0\le 4\det(w_2,w_3,w_4)^2 =\Delta(x_{ij}).
    $$
We also, get the following vanishing result when $x_{ij}$ is expressed
as a polynomials in the components.
$$
    0 = R(x_{ij}),\quad x_{ij} = x_{ij}(r_*,s_*,t_*,u_*).
    $$
(The statement $R=0$ can be interpreted as saying the four-dimensional volume of a simplex in $\ring{R}^3$
is zero.)

that $\{v_1,\ldots,v_3\}\subset\ring{R}^3$ is not a collinear
set. 
Suppose that $v_4$ lies in the plane of $S$.
Let $S_i = S\setminus \{v_i\}$ and $c_i = \op{coef}_i(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$. 
Then for $i=1,2,3$, 
   $$
   \begin{array}{lll}
     c_i > 0  & \Leftrightarrow & v_i \in \op{aff}_+^0(S_i,\{v_4\})\\
     c_i = 0 & \Leftrightarrow & v_i \in \op{aff}(S_i)\\
     c_i < 0 & \Leftrightarrow & v_i \in \op{aff}_-^0(S_i,\{v_4\})\\
     \end{array}
   $$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
  Let $L_i =\op{aff}(S_i)$.
If $\op{coef}_i(v_1,\ldots,v_4)=0$, then $v_4$
has the form
	$$
	v_4 = t_1 v_1 + \cdots + t_3 v_3,
	$$
with $t_i=0$.  It is clear that these are
precisely the points in the given line $L_i$.
Now if $t_i>0$,
elements of
$\op{conv}\{v_4,v_i\}$ have the form
	$$s v_4 + (1-s) v_i,\quad 0\le s \le 1.$$
The coefficient of $v_i$ in this expression
is $1-s(1-t_i)>0$.  Thus, $\op{conv}\{v_4,v_i\}$
does not meet the line $L_i$, and $v_i$ and $v_4$
lie in the same half-plane.  Similarly,
if $t_i<0$, then $1-s(1-t_i)=0$ has a solution
in $s\in(0,1)$, so that the line $L_i$ separates the
points $v_i$ and $v_4$.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:construct-pt-plane}  
Assume that $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}\subset\ring{R}^3$ is not collinear.
Let $a_{01},a_{02},a_{03}\in\ring{R}$ be such that
$$
   \Delta(a_{01},a_{02},a_{03},x_{23},x_{13}x_{12})=0,
$$
where $x_{ij}=|v_i-v_j|^2$.
Then there exists a unique point $v_0$ such that $|v_0-v_i|^2 = a_{0i}$, for $i=1,2,3$.
In fact, 
  $$
  v_0 = t_1 v_1 + t_2 v_2 + t_3 v_3, \hbox{ where } t_i = \frac{\Delta_{(01)}}{\ups},
  $$
$\ups=\ups(x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})$ and $\Delta_{(ij)} = \partial\Delta/\partial x_{ij}(a_{01},\ldots,x_{12})$.
Moreover, $v_0$ lies in the plane $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  
%Let $\ups=\ups(x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})$.  Write $\Delta_{(ij)} = \partial\Delta/\partial x_{ij}(a_{01},\ldots,x_{12})$.
%Set 
%$$
%  v_0 = t_1 v_1 + t_2 v_2 + t_3 v_3,\hbox{ where } t_i = \frac{\Delta_{(01)}}{\ups}.
%$$
Note that $t_1+t_2+t_3=1$, so that $v_0\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.
A direct calculation shows that $v_0$ has the required properties.
For example,
$$\begin{array}{lll}
 |v_0-v_1|^2 &= |t_2 (v_2-v_1) + t_3 (v_3-v_1)|^2 = t_2^2 x_{12} + t_2 t_3 (x_{13}+x_{12}-x_{23})  + t_3^2 x_{13} \\ &=
 a_{01} - \frac{\Delta}u = a_{01}.\end{array}
$$
If $v_0'$ is a second solution, then $v_0'\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ by Lemma~\ref{tarski:delta0}.
Also, if $w=v_0-v_0'$ then, we may write
   $$w = t_1 (v_1-v_3) + t_2 (v_2-v_3)$$
From the equations 
    $$
    |v_0-v_i|^2 = |v_0'-v_i|^2,
    $$
it follows that $w\cdot (v_i-v_3) = 0$, so also that
    $$w\cdot w = \sum t_i w\cdot (v_i-v_3) = 0.$$
Hence $w=0$ and $v_0'=v_0$.  (Compare the uniqueness proof in Lemma~\ref{tarski:circumcenter}.)

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:circum2}
Let $S= \{v_a,v_b,v_c\}$ be a set of three points in $\ring{R}^3$.
Set $a = |v_b
- v_c|$, $b = |v_a - v_c|$, $c = |v_a  - v_b |$.  If $v_a,v_b,v_c$
are not collinear then a unique circumcenter exists.  The circumcenter is
    $$p = \alpha_a v_a + \alpha_b v_b + \alpha_c v_c$$
where
    $$%\begin{array}{lll}
    \alpha_a = \frac{a^2(- a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{2\ups(a^2,b^2,c^2)},\quad

    %\end{array}

The circumradius equals $\eta(a,b,c)$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proved} Note that for $r\ge 0$,
$$\Delta(r,r,r,a^2,b^2,c^2) = -a^2 b^2 c^2 + r^2\ups(a^2,b^2,c^2),$$
which vanishes exactly when $r = \eta(a^2,b^2,c^2)$.  (If $r$ is not this value, 
then $\Delta\ne0$ and by Lemma~\ref{tarski:delta0} there is no point in the plane at distance
$r$ from $v_a,v_b,v_c$.)  By Lemma~\ref{tarski:construct-pt-plane}, the circumcenter exists and
we find that $\eta(a^2,b^2,c^2)$ is the circumradius.  That lemma also gives a formula
for the circumcenter, which specializes to the given formula in the lemma.

\begin{proved} 
We assume for a contradiction that there exists a set $S$ for
which $\op{conv}(e)$ meets $\op{conv}(e')$.  Set $|v_i-v_j|=x_{ij}$. Contract $|v_1-v_3|$
preserving constraints and intersection until we
reduce to configurations in which equality
holds in the lower bounds:
	$$|v_1-v_2|=m_{12},\ |v_2-v_3|=m_{23},\ |v_3-v_4|=m_{34},\ 
      |v_4-v_1|=m_{14},$$   
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:cm4-large} and Lemma~\ref{tarski:partial-delta-ups}, we find that
$\partial\Delta/\partial x_{13}<0$.   Similarly for the $x_{24}$ partial.
Along the curve $\Delta=0$, the implicit derivative $d x_{13}/d x_{24} <0$.  
We may therefore contract $|v_1-v_3|$ until $|v_2-v_4|=M_{24}$.  Then we use
the sign of $\partial\Delta/\partial x_{13}$ again to see that
   $$0 = \Delta(x_{13},\ldots) > \Delta(M^2_{13},\ldots) \ge 0.$$
This is a contradiction.

deform until $y_{12}=M_{12}$ and $y_{23}=M_{23}$.    Deform $v_4$ until two of the
lower bound constraints $y_{i4}\ge m_{i4}$ reach their minimum. 
Say $y_{14}=m_{14}$ and $y_{24}=m_{24}$.
The configuration is planar, so

Any quadratic polynomial with negative leading coefficent is an increasing function on

(as in the proof of Lemma~\tref{tarski:face})
until $|v_3-v_1| = M_{13}$ and $|v_3-v_2|=M_{23}$.   Next pivot $v_1$, increasing $|v_1-v_2|$
until $v_1,v_2,$ and $v_4$ are collinear.  Slide $v_4$ along $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ until
it has distance $m$ from $v_1$ or $v_2$ (say $v_1$).   Constrain $v_4$ so that further
deformations keep it along  $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ at distance $m$ from $v_1$.  
Fix $v_1,v_3$ and pivot $v_2$ around $v_3$ toward $v_1$.
%Deform the figure, by moving $v_2$ directly toward $v_1$ and $v_4$, while moving
%$v_3$ at the same time to preserve the constraints on $|v_3-v_1|$ and $|v_3-v_2|$. 
By the assumptions on the constants $M_*$ and $m$, this is increasing in $|v_3-v_4|$.  The conditions
on the constants also insure that the deformation cannot lead to a situation in which
$v_1,v_2,v_3$ are collinear.  Continue
until $|v_2-v_4|=m$.

Let $v_3' = v_4 - (v_3-v_4)$ be the reflection of $v_3$ about $v_4$.  The four vectors
$v_1,v_2,v_3,v_3'$ form a planar quadrilateral with diagonals $|v_1-v_2|=2m$ and $|v_3-v_3'| \ge 2m_{34}$.
The line through $v_1,v_2$ separates $v_3$ from $v_3'$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:cm4-large},  
$r = |v_3-v_3'|^2$ is
the largest root of the given quadratic polynomial.  So $r \ge (2 m_{34})^2$.  This is contrary
to hypothesis.

\section{Trigonometry}
\tlabel{sec:trig}


It is often useful to make arguments based on angle in the proofs
of elementary problems in geometry. The angle $\gamma$
of a triangle with sides
$a,b,c$ on the side opposite $c$ is
    $$
    \gamma = \arc(a,b,c)=\arccos(\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2 a b}).
    $$
This cannot be used in the Tarski language because of the trigonometric
function $\arccos$.  We will avoid mentioning the function
$\arc(a,b,c)$ in the statements of the lemmas.
In fact, we will often work with $\cosarc(a,b,c) = \cos(\arc(a,b,c))$.
\indy{Index}{cosarc} 
However, whenever, we have a comparison of
two angles
    $$
    \arc(a,b,c) \le \arc(a',b',c'),
    $$
we may take the cosine of both sides to express the inequality in
elementary terms.  In this way, some non-elementary arguments
can be reduced to inequalities of rational functions.  When
$S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ is a set of three points in $\ring{R}^3$, we write
   $$
   \arc_V(v_1,v_2,v_3) = \arc(|v_1-v_2|,|v_1-v_3|,|v_2-v_3|).
   $$

Another useful definition is that of dihedral angle.  Let 
$S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ be a set of four points in $\ring{R}^3$.
The lune $\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_3,v_4\})$ is the intersection
of two half-spaces $\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_2,v_i\},\{v_j\})$ with
$\{i,j\}=\{3,4\}$.  The angle formed by these two half-spaces along
the line $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$ is the dihedral angle of the lune,
and is denoted by $\dih_V(\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_3,v_4\})$.  It is a function
of the distances $y_{ij} = |v_i-v_j|$.  It is known that
 $$
 \dih_V(\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_3,v_4\}) = 
  \dih(y_{12},y_{13},y_{14},y_{34},y_{24},y_{12}),
 $$
where setting $x_{ij}=y_{ij}^2$, we have
 $$\begin{array}{lll}
  \dih(y_{12},y_{13},y_{14},y_{34},y_{24},y_{12}) &=
  \arccos\left(\frac{\Delta_{(34)}(x_{ij})}{\sqrt{
    \ups(x_{12},x_{13},x_{23})\ups(x_{12},x_{14},x_{24})}}\right)\\
    &=\frac{\pi}{2} - \atn
     \left({\sqrt{4 x_{12} \Delta(x_{ij})}},{\Delta_{(34)}(x_{ij})}\right).
  \end{array} 
 $$
Recall that $\Delta_{(ij)}$ is an abbreviation for 
$\partial\Delta/\partial x_{ij}$.  We use $\dih_V$ for the
vector version of the function and $\dih$ for the function of
edge lengths.
It is fortunate that angles are expressed in terms of the 
core functions ($\ups$, $\Delta$) of this collection.  Of course,
this is no coincidence.


A comparison of two dihedral angles can be reduced to an inequality
of rational functions. We also see that statements such as
  $$
  \dih_V(\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_3,v_4\}) < \pi/2
  $$
can be rewritten in elementary terms.  From the explicit formula
for dihedral angle, this particular inequality
is equivalent to $\Delta_{(34)}(x_{ij}) > 0$.

The partial derivatives of $\dih$ are again readily expressed in
terms of the core functions.
% - x12 D[del, x24]/(Ups[x12, x13, x23] Sqrt[x12 del]);
To give one example, we have
  $$
  \frac{\partial\dih(y_{12},y_{13},y_{14},y_{34},y_{24},\sqrt{x_{23}})}
  {\partial x_{23}} = 
  \frac{ -x_{12} \Delta_{(24)}(x_{ij})} {\ups(x_{12},x_{13},x_{23})
   \sqrt{x_{12}\Delta(x_{ij})}}
  $$
From this, we see that the monotonicity of $\dih$
in the $x_{23}$ direction is controlled by the sign of
$-\Delta_{(24)}$.




In summary, we will refrain from mentioning functions such as
$\arc(a,b,c)$ and $\dih_V$ in the statements of lemmas.  However,
we will to use them in proofs.  Most of the time, we use
these functions in proofs in such a way that the inverse
trigonometric functions
can be easily eliminated.



\section{Pivot}

A number of arguments are based on a consraint preserving deformation
that is called a {\it pivot}.   This has already come up in a two-dimensional
context in Lemma~\ref{tarski:skinny-tri}.  Here we give a detailed description. 
Let $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ be a set
of three points.  Let $L=\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$ and let $A$ be
the plane orthogonal to $L$ that passes through the point $v_3$.
Let $r$ be the distance from $v_3$ to $L$.  Let $A\cap L = \{p\}$.

The point $v_3$ lies on the circle
   $$
   \{u \in A \mid r = |u - p|\}.
   $$
The motion of $v_3$ along this circle is called pivoting $v_3$
around the axis $\{v_1,v_2\}$.   Pivoting preserves the distance from
$v_3$ to $v_1$ and $v_2$.   In general, the pivot can move
either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle.  To fix
the direction of rotation, we will often specify that the pivot
should move towards (or away from) a given point $v_4\in\ring{R}^3$.

\pdffig{pivot}{pivot}{A pivot is the motion of a point
around a circle with given axis.}


Usually, it is understood that the pivoting motion should continue
until one of the constraints of the lemma prevents further motion.
This often takes the form of an upper or lower bound distance
constraint involving $v_3$.  For example, we might have a constraint
$|v_3-v_4|\le M$, which would force the pivot to stop when $|v_3-v_4|=M$.
Often, there are several possible constraints that may become active
and halt the pivot.  When this happens, the proof may branch into several
cases, depending on which constraint becomes active.

It is useful to be able to detect by inspection whether a given
distance $|v_3-v_4|$ is increasing or decreasing under a pivot $v_3$
around an axis $\{v_1,v_2\}$.   The infinitesimal pivot of $v_3$ 
around the axis $\{v_1,v_2\}$ is in the direction $n$ for some normal
to the plane
$\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$. 
To first order $v_3$ at time $t$, $v_3(t)$ can be given as $v_3+t n$.
We have the approximation
  $$
  |(v_3(t)-v_4|^2 \approx |(v_3+t n)-v_4|^2 
  \approx |v_3-v_4|^2 + 2 t n \cdot (v_3-v_4).
  $$
Thus, the sign of the derivative of $|v_3(t)-v_4|^2$ is determined by the
sign of $n\cdot (v_3-v_4)$.


Pivots do not appear in any of the statements of the lemmas.  They
are way of deforming the figure presented in a lemma in a way to make
the lemma easier to prove.

    $d_{(23)}\le0$.
Without loss of generality, $x_{23}=3.2^2$.

Let $c$ be a point of intersection of the plane $P=\op{aff}(v_0,p,p')$ with
the circle at distance $\lambda=1.6$ from $v_1$ on the sphere centered

Suppose that  $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,w_1,w_2\}$
is a packing of five points.
Suppose that $S'=\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ is not collinear and that 
the circumradius of $S'$ is less than

$\op{conv}(S')$ does not meet $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  Assume for a contradiction that they meet. 
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:eta-min}, the condition on the circumradius implies that
	$$|v_i-v_j| < \sqrt8, \text{ for } i\ne j.$$
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:cross}, the constraints prevent 	$\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$
from meeting $\op{conv}\{v_i,v_j\}$ for $i\ne j$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:face},
the points $w_i$ do not meet $\op{conv}(S')$.

Pivot in a constraint satisfying way until $|w_i-v_j|=2$, for
$i=1,2$, $j=1,2,3$.  Let $p$ be the circumcenter of $S'$ with circumradius
% Let $v'_1$ be the
%point on the circumscribing circle of $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ diametrically
%opposite $v_1$.  Then $w_1,w_2,v_1,v_1'$ give the vertices of a planar
%rhombus with side $2$.
$r=\eta_V(v_1,v_2,v_3)$. The Pythagorean theorem gives
   $$
   4 = |v_1-w_2|^2 = |v_1-p|^2 + |p-w_2|^2 = r^2 + \frac{|w_1-w_2|^2}4 \le r^2 + 2.

\begin{proved}
We assume such a figure exists.  We deform in such a way that the constraints continue
to hold and that is non-increasing in the length $|v_1-v_5|$.  By the conditions of the
lemma and Lemmas~\tref{tarski:cross} and \tref{tarski:face}, 
the edge $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_5\}$
does not meet the
 edges $\op{conv}\{v_i,v_j\}$, $(i,j)=(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)$ 
and the points $v_1,v_5$
do not meet $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  As we deform in a way that preserves constraints,
these conditions continue to hold.  By these constraints we see that the condition
  $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_5\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$
continues to hold under any deformation that preserves the other constraints.

By a series of constraint preserving pivots, we bring the figure to one that satisfies
	$$
	\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
	|v_2-v_3|&=M_{23}, &|v_2-v_4| &= M_{24}, &|v_3-v_4| &= M_{34}\\
	|v_1-v_2|&=m_{12}, &|v_1-v_3| &= m_{13}, &|v_1-v_4| &= m_{14}\\
	|v_5-v_2|&=m_{25}, &|v_5-v_3| &= m_{35}, &|v_5-v_4| &= m_{45}.
	\end{array}
	$$
Under these conditions, we find by the definition of $\CalE$ 
that $\CalE = |v_1-v_5|$.  Thus, we reach the contradiction
	$$
	\CalE = |v_1-v_5| \le M_{15} < \CalE.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:dcg-1220}
  There does not exist a set $\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v,w\}$ of five points
in $\ring{R}^3$ with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\op{conv}\{v,w\}$ meets $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$.
  \item $2\le |u-v_0| \le 2.51$, for $u=v_1,w,v,v_2$.
    \item $|v-v_1|\ge 3.2$,  $|v-v_2|\ge 2$,
    \item $|w-v_1|\ge2$, $|w-v_2|\ge2$,
    \item   $|v-w|\le2$, $2\le |v_1-v_2|\le 3.2$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} Assume the set of solutions is nonempty.  The constraints are
translation invariant.  Thus, without loss of generality $v_0=0$.  The space $X$
of solutions in $(v_1,v_2,v,w)\in\ring{R}^{12}$ 
is closed and bounded hence compact.  The function
$$
   g(v_0,v,w) = |v-w| + |w-v_0| + |v_0-v|
$$
is continuous on $X$.  Let $X_1\subset X$ be the nonempty compact set on which
the function $g$ attains its maximum.
The function
$$
   g_1(v_0,v_1,v_2,v,w) = \sum_{u = v_0,v,w}\sum_{i=1}^2 |v_i-u|
$$
is continuous on $X_1$.  Let $(v_0,v_1,v_2,v,w)$ be a point that
minimizes $g_1$ over $X_1$.  We study the properties of this particular solution.

If the segment $\op{conv}^0\{v,w\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$,
then the desired impossibility proof follows by
   $$
   E(2,2,2,  3.2,2.51,2.51,  2,2, 3.2; 2).
   $$
Hence, the segment $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v_2\}$ 
meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,w\}$.

We distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,w\}\setminus \op{conv}^0\{v_0,v,w\}$.
\item $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,v,w\}$.
\end{itemize}
In the second case, the figure is rigid, with $|v-w|$, $|w-v_0|$ and $|v_0-v|$ attaining
their upper bounds and $|v_i-u|$ attaining their lower bounds.  By direct calculation of
dihedral angles, we have the contradiction
$$
\pi\ge \dih_V(\{v_0,w\},\{v_1,v_2\})= \dih_V(\{v_0,w\},\{v_1,v\})+ \dih_V(\{v_0,w\},\{v,v_2\})
> 2.4+1.2 >\pi.
$$

We now turn to the first case.  The edges $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ and $\op{conv}\{v,w\}$
cannot meet by Lemma~\ref{tarski:cross-edge-generic}.  Swapping $v$ and $w$ if necessary,
we may assume that $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,w\}$.  We have
$|w-v|=2$, for otherwise $g$ is not maximal (pivot $v_1$).  Similarly, $|v-v_0|=2.51$,
$|v_2-v|=2$, and $|v_1-v|=3.2$.

%The proof
%follows by a constraint preserving deformation, 
%provided that $\{v_0,v_1,v_2,w\}$
%are not coplanar. Assume for a contradiction that 
%   $$
%   w\in P=\op{aff}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}.
%   $$ 
%We move back to the nonplanar case if
%$|v_2-v|$ is not $2$ (pivot $v_2$ around $\{v_0,w\}$ toward $v$), if
%$|v_1-v|$ is not $3.2$ (pivot $v_1$ around $\{v_0,w\}$ toward $v$), if
%$|w-v|$ is not $2$ (pivot $w$ around $\{v_1,v_2\}$ away from $v$),
%or $v$ is not $2.51$ (pivot $v$ and $w$ simultaneously preserving
%$|w-v|$ around $\{v_1,v_2\}$).  Therefore, we may assume without
%loss of generality that $|v_2-v|=2$, $|v_1-v|=3.2$, $|w-v|=2$, and
%$|v-v_0|=2.51$.


Let $p$ be the orthogonal projection of $v$ to the plane $P$.  Let
$h=|v-p|$. 
The distances from $p$ to $u\in P$ is
$f_h(|v-u|)$, where $f_h(x)=\sqrt{x^2-h^2}$.
Note that
$$
2\le |v_2-w|\le |v_2-p|+|p-w|=f_h(|v_2-v|)+f_h(|v-w|) = 2 f_h(2) = 2\sqrt{4-h^2}.
$$
Hence, $0\le h \le\sqrt3$.
%(The upper bound
%$\sqrt3$ is determined by the condition that the triangle
%$\{w,v_1,v\}$, which is equilateral in the extreme case, must exist under
%the given edge constraints.)

%We consider two cases depending
%on whether we can find a line in $P$ through $p$ dividing the
%plane into a half-plane containing $v_1$, $v_0$, and $v_2$, or into
%a half-plane containing $v_1$, $w$, and $v_2$.  In the first case
%we have

Note that $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$ separates $v_0$ from $w$.  If
$p\in \op{aff}_+^0(\{v_1,v_2\},v_0)$, then 
 $$
\begin{array}{lll}
    0&=\arc_V(p,v_0,v_1)+
    \arc_V(p,v_0,v_2)- \arc_V(p,v_1,v_2)\\
    &\ge \arc(f_h(3.2),f_h(2.51),2)+
    \arc(f_h(2),f_h(2.51),2)-\arc(f_h(3.2),f_h(2),3.2)
\end{array}
 $$
The function $\arc$ is monotonic in the arguments and from this it
follows easily that this function of $h$ is positive on its domain
$0\le h\le \sqrt3$. This is a contradiction.  

Otherwise, we obtain the
related contradiction
  $$
\begin{array}{lll}
    0&=\arc_V(p,v_1,w)+
    \arc_V(p,w,v_2)-
    \arc_v(p,v_1,v_2)\\
    &\ge \arc(f_h(3.2),f_h(2),2)+
    \arc(f_h(2),f_h(2),2)-\arc(f_h(3.2),f_h(2),3.2)\\

%\FIWW{I'm not sure the second part gets used.  Deleting it would simplify the proof.}
Let $\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3,w\}$  be a packing of five points.
Assume $2.51\le|w-v_0|\le\sqr8$, $|v_1-v_3|\le\sqr8$.
Assume that $|u-v|\le 2.51$, with $u=v_1,v_2,v_3$,
$v=v_0,w$.
Assume that $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,w,v_2\}$.
Then
$\min(|v_1-v_2|,|v_2-v_3|)\le2.51$. Furthermore, if the minimum is
$2.51$, then $|v_1-v_2|=|v_2-v_3|=2.51$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proved}
Assume that $|v_1-v_2|\ge 2.51$ and $|v_2-v_3|\ge2.51$.

We have $|v_1-v_3|=\sqrt8$.  Otherwise,
$|v_1-v_3|=r<\sqrt8$, and the configuration does not exist by
exist by the calculation
  $$
  E(2.51,2,2,\sqrt8,2.51,2.51,2.51,2,2; r).
  $$
We have $|v_0-w|=\sqrt8$, for otherwise $|v_0-w|=r<\sqrt8$ and
$$
   E(2.51,2,2,r,2.51,2.51,2.51,2,2,\sqrt8).
$$
We have $|w-v_3|=2$, for otherwise,
$|w-v_3|=2+s$, with $s>0$, and  
the configuration does not exist:
  $$
  E(2.51,2,2+s,\sqrt8,2.51,2.51,2.51,2,2;\sqrt8). 
  $$
Similarly, $|w-v_i|=|v_0-v_i|=2$, for $i=1,3$.

Thus, $(v_0,v_1,w,v_3)$ is a square.
 We may also assume, without loss of generality, that
$|w-v_2|=|v_2-v_0|=2.51$. This forces $|v_2-v_i|=2.51$, for $i=1,3$.
This is rigid,  and is the unique figure that satisfies the
constraints. The lemma follows.

%disk does not meet $C$.  This disk is contained in $B(v,\sqrt2)$,
%and so we bound this ball away from the given cone.
%
%Assume for a contradiction that these two sets meet.  Let $v'$ be
%the reflection of $v$ through the plane $P = \op{aff}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$.
%Let $p=(v'+v)/2$ be the closed point of $P$ to $v$.

%If $p$  lies outside $C$, then the

%$|v_2-v_0|,|v_3-v_0|\le\sqrt8$, this closest point has distance at least
%$\sqrt2$ from $v$. Thus, we may assume that the closest point in
%$P$ to $v$ lies in $C$.
%
%Assume next that $p$ lies in 
%$\op{conv}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$.  We obtain an edge
%$\op{conv}^0\{v,v'\}$ of length at most $\sqrt8$ that meets a

%
%Assume finally that $p\in\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_2,v_3\})$,

%moving $v$ toward $C$ (preserving $|v-v_0|$), we may assume that

%assume that the circumradius of $\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$ is precisely
%$\sqrt2$.  Since the closest point in $P$ is not in 
% $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$, we may move $v_2$ and $v_3$ away from $v$ while
%preserving the circumradius and increasing the lengths $|v-v_2|$ and

%loss of generality that $|v_2-v_0|=|v_3-v_0|=2$ and $|v_2-v_3|=\sqrt8$. We
%have reduced to a one-parameter family of arrangements, parametrized
%by $|v-v_0|$. We observe that the disk $D$ is
%tangent to the segment $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3\}$ at its midpoint, no matter what
%the value of $|v-v_0|$ is.  Thus, in the extremal case, the open disk

$C = \op{cone}(v_0,\{v_2,v_3\})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
Let $D$ be the open disk spanning the circle of intersection of
$B(v_0,\sqrt2)$ and $B(v_1,\sqrt2)$.  The union of the rays from $v_0$
through $D$ is all of $\op{rcone}^0$.  It is enough to show that this
disk does not meet $C$.  This disk is contained in $B(v,\sqrt2)$,
and  we bound this ball away from the given cone.

Let $p$ be the orthogonal 
projection of $v_1$ to the plane $P=\op{aff}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$.
If $p$  lies outside $C$, then the
edge constraint $|v_1-v_0|\le 2.51$ forces the closest point in $C$ to
lie in $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_2\}\cup\op{conv}\{v_0,v_3\}$.  Since
$|v_2-v_0|,|v_3-v_0|\le\sqrt8$, this closest point has distance at least
$\sqrt2$ from $v_1$. Thus, we may assume that the closest point in
$P$ to $v_1$ lies in $C$.
We may now assume that $p\in C$.

Let $v_1'$ be the reflection of $v_1$ through $P$.  We
have that either $\op{conv}^0\{v_2,v_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v'_1\}$ or
$\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v'_1\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$.  We may assume for
a contradiction that $|v_1-v'_1|<\sqrt8$.

If $\op{conv}^0\{v_2,v_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v'_1\}$, then
Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-anchor} gives the contradiction
$|v_1-v_2|\le2.51$.

If $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v'_1\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$, then by
Lemma~\tref{tarski:qrtet-pair-pass} the longest edge of $\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$
has length greater than $2.51$. 
Moreover, $v_1$ and $v'_1$ both have distances at most $2.51$
from both endpoints of the longest edge of $\{v_0,v_2,v_3\}$, 
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-anchor}.  Since
$|v_1-v_2|>2.51$, the longest edge must not have $v_2$ as an endpoint,
so the longest edge is $\{v_0,v_3\}$.
Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-makes-quarter} forces one of $|v_1-v_2|$ or
$|v_1'-v_2|$ to be at most $2.51$. But these are both equal to
$|v_1-v_2|>2.51$, a contradiction.

\sqrt8$ for $i\ne j$ and $\{i,j\}\ne\{1,4\}$. Then $v_5$ does not lie
in $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.
\end{lemma}

%The proof in \cite[Lemma 3.5]{part1} is based on spherical trigonometry.
%Here, we give an alternate proof.

\begin{proved}
The conditions of Lemma~\tref{tarski:skinny-tri} are met. This implies
that $v_5$ does not lie in $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_4,v_2\}$ or
	$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_4,v_3\}$.
The conditions of Lemma~\tref{tarski:face} are met.  This implies that
$v_5$ does not lie in $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ or
	$\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_1\}$.
By a series of pivots, we may assume that
	$$|v_1-v_2|=|v_1-v_3|=|v_2-v_3|=|v_2-v_4|=|v_3-v_4|=\sqrt8.$$
By a series of pivots of $v_5$, we may assume that its distance is exactly
$2$ from three of $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  
Pivot $v_4$ in a constraint satisfying way to decrease $|v_5-v_4|$.
If $|v_1-v_4|<\sqrt8$, then Lemma~\tref{tarski:v-interior} % not skinny
gives the
result.
Eventually, $v_5$ has distance exactly $2$ from all four other points.
The set $S$ has circumradius $2$ and circumcenter $v_5\in\op{conv}(S)$.  
	We have with $M=\sqrt8$:
	$$0 < \chi(M^2,M^2,M^2,y^2,M^2,M^2)= M^2 y^2 (2M^2 - y^2).$$
Hence $|v_1-v_4|=y < 4$.
Let $r(y)$ be the circumradius of a simplex with edges $\{M,M,M,y,M,M)$.
Then we have the contradiction
	$$2 = r(|v_1-v_4|) < r(\sqrt2) = 2.$$

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:anc-simplex-not-enc}\usage{DCG-[11.5] page 115}
% This states that there is nothing enclosed over a slice.
Let $S=\{w,v_0,v,v_1,v_2\}$ be a packing of five points.
Suppose that
  $$\begin{array}{rlrlrlrl}
    |v-v_1|&\le 2.51, &
    |v-v_2|&\le 2.51, &
    |v_0-v_1|&\le 2.51,&

    && |v_0-v|&\le \sqrt8,&
    &&2.51\le|v_0-w|&< \sqrt8,\\
  \end{array}
  $$
Assume that $w\in\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2,v\})$. 
Then $|w-v|\le 2.51$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:point-in-simplex}, 
$w\not\in\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v\}$.  
If $|v_1-v_2|\le \sqrt{8}$, the result follows from
Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-makes-quarter}. 

Assume that a figure exists with $|v_1-v_2|>\sqrt{8}$. Suppose for a
contradiction that $|v-w|>2.51$.    Pivot $v_1$ around $\{v_0,v_2\}$ until
$|v-v_1|=2.51$ and $v_2$ around $\{v_0,v_1\}$ until $|v-v_2|=2.51$.  Rescale
$w$ so that $|w-v_0|=\sqrt{8}$. Set $x = |v_1-v_2|$. If, through constraint
preserving deformations, $w$ is not deformed into the plane of 
$\{v_0,v_2,v_1\}$,
then we are left with the one-dimensional family $|w'-v_0|=|w'-w|=2$, for
$w'=v_2,v_1$, $|v-w|=|v-v_0|=|v_1-v|=|v_2-v|=2.51$, depending on  $x$. This
gives a contradiction
    $$
    \begin{array}{lll}
        \pi &\ge \dih_V(\{v_2,v_1\},\{v_0,v\}) + \dih_V(\{v_2,v_1\},\{v,w\})\\
        &= 2\dih(x,2,2.51,2.51,2.51,2)
         > \pi,
    \end{array}
    $$
for $x>\sqrt{8}$.
(Equality is attained if $x=\sqrt{8}$.)

Thus, we may assume that $w$ lies in the plane $P=\op{aff}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$. Take the
circle in $P$ at distance $2.51$ from $v$. The vertices $v_0$ and $w$ lie
on or outside the circle. The vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ lie on the
circle, so the diameter is at least $x>\sqrt{8}$.  The distance from
$v$ to $P$ is less than $x_0= \sqrt{2.51^2-2}$.  The edge 
$\op{conv}\{v_0,w\}$ cannot
contain the center of the circle, because $|w-v_0|$ is less than the
diameter.
%
Reflect $v$ through $P$ to get $v'$.  Then $|v-v'|< 2x_0$. Swapping
$v_1$ and $v_2$ as necessary, we may assume that 
  $$w\in\op{cone}(v_0,\{v,v',v_2\}).$$  
The desired bound $|v-w|\le 2.51$ now follows from
  $$
  \Delta(2x,2.51,2.51,\sqrt8,2.51,2.51)>0,
  $$
for $0\le x< x_0$ and
  $$

Let $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ be a set of four points
in $\ring{R}^3$.  Assume that the points are not coplanar.
Let $x_{ij} = |v_i-v_j|^2$, for $1\le i < j\le 3$.
Let $a_{01},a_{02},a_{03}$ be three positive real numbers such that
$$
  \Delta(a_{01},a_{02},a_{03},x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})\ge0.

Then there exists a unique point $v_0\in\op{aff}^+(\{v_1,v_2,v_3\},v_4)$
such that
   $|v_0-v_i|^2 = a_{0i}$, for $i=1,2,3$.
Furthermore, $v_0\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ if and only if 
 $$
  \Delta(a_{01},a_{02},a_{03},x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})=0.
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} 
%If we pick coordinates of the form $v_1=(0,0,0)$,
%$v_2=(*,0,0)$, $v_3=(*,*,0)$, then we have a quadratic equation to
%solve for $v_0$.  It gives solutions of the form
%   $$
%   v_0 = (*,*,\pm\sqrt{\Delta/\ups}),
%   $$
%where $\ups = \ups(x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})$.  The assumption that the points
%are not coplanar, implies that $v_2,v_3,v_4$ are not collinear, and that
%$\ups>0$.  We pick the sign of the square root, so that it lands in the
%same half-space as $v_4$. 
$$
\Delta(a_{01}-h,a_{02}-h,a_{03}-h,x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})=
\Delta(a_{01},a_{02},a_{03},x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})-h\ups(x_{23},x_{13},x_{12}).
$$
The coefficent of $h$ is positive by Lemma~\ref{tarski:cayley-menger-pos} and \ref{tarski:ups0}.
So there exists a unique $h\ge 0$ that makes the left-hand side zero.
By Lemma~\ref{tarski:construct-pt-plane} there exists a unique $w\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ such that
 $$
 |w-v_i|^2 = a_{0i} - h.
 $$
Then a solution $v_0$ is given by
 $$
 v_0 = w + \sqrt{h} n,
 $$
where $n$ is a unit normal to the plane $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ whose sign is chosen
so that $v_0\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_2,v_3\},v_4)$.  Any other solution can be written in the
form 
  $$
  v_0' = w' + \sqrt{h'} n,
  $$
where $w'\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.  This forces $h'=h$ and the uniqueness of $w$ gives
$w'=w$, so that $v_0=v_0'$.  Finally, $v_0\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ exactly when $h=0$,
or equivalently, $\Delta(a_{01},\ldots)=0$.

We consider four cases, depending on the signs of $t_0,t_1$.

Note that the last three arguments of $\chi_k$

Under the assumption that $S$ does not lie

We compute directly that $p$ given by this
formula has the same distance from each point
$v_i$.  If $p'$ is a second circumradius, then in 
barycentric coordinates we have that
  $$p'-p = \sum_i t_i v_i.$$
The condition that $p$ and $p'$ have the same distance to each $v_i$
gives
  $$(p'-p)\cdot v_i=0.$$
Then $$|p'-p|^2 = \sum_it_i (p'-p)\cdot v_i = 0.$$  
Thus, $p'=p$.

%pairs of vertices in $F$

   $$
   |v_1-v_i|\le 2.51, \quad i=2,3,4.
   $$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  
Assume for a contradiciton that $|v_1-v_i|> 2.51$ for some $i$.
The orientation of $v_1$ is determined by the sign of the function
$\chi$ (see Lemma~\tref{tarski:chi}). 
Let $x_{ij}=|v_i-v_j|^2$.  
Note that $\partial\chi/\partial x_{12} = x_{34}
(-x_{34}+x_{24}+x_{23})$.  By our
constraints on the lengths of edges, 
$-x_{34}+x_{24}+x_{23}\ge0$. Thus, we have monotonicity in the variable $x_{12}$,
and the same is true of $x_{13}$, and $x_{14}$. Also, $\chi$ is
quadratic with negative leading coefficient in each of the
variables $x_{34}$, $x_{24}$, $x_{23}$. Thus, to check positivity, when any
of the lengths is greater than $2.51$, it is enough to evaluate
$$\chi(2^2,2^2,2.51^2,x^2,y^2,z^2), \quad

Let $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ be a set of three points

$\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$, with bounding line $L_i$ of $H_i$.  
Suppose that the intersection
   $$H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3$$
is nonempty and bounded.  Let $w_i\in L_j\cap L_k$.  Then
$w_i\in H_i$ and
   $$H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3 = \op{conv}^0\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  If some $w_i=w_j$, then all three lines meet
In this case, since the half-planes
are open, $H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3$ is empty or unbounded, which is contrary to 
hypothesis.  Now assume that $w_i$ are all distinct.

If $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ is collinear, then we have $L_1=L_2=L_3$.
In this case, $H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3$ is empty or the entire
unbounded set $H_1$.  This is contrary to hypothesis.

Thus, we have $L_i = \op{aff}\{w_j,w_k\}$ and
$H_i = \op{aff}^0_{\sigma(i)}(\{w_j,w_k\},w_i)$, for some choice of
signs $\sigma(i)\in\{\pm\}$.  
Depending on the signs $\sigma(i)$, we find that in barycentric
coordinates with respect to $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$, we have
  $$H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3 =
    \{ t_1 w_1 + t_2 w_2 +t_3 w_3 \mid
         t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 1,\quad  \sigma(i)t_i > 0\}.$$
If two signs differ, then the set is unbounded.  If all signs
are negative, then the set is empty.  So all signs are positive.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:vor-bar}
Let $S=\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ be a packing of four points.
Assume that they are not coplanar.
Assume that 
$$
|v_i-v_j|<\sqrt8,\quad 1\le i < j \le 3.
$$
  Suppose that
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ meets $\Omega(v_0,S)$.  Then $v_0$ has negative
orientation with respect to $S$.  Similarly, if 
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ meets $\bar\Omega(v_0,S)$.  Then $v_0$ has nonpositive
orientation with respect to $S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} Let $R = \op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}\cap\Omega(v_0,S)$.
It is not empty.  It is convex, but does not meet the edges
$\op{conv}\{v_i,v_j\}$ of $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.  Therefore it
is bounded.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:bounded-tri}, we have that
$R = \op{conv}^0\{w_{12},w_{23},w_{13}\}$, where $w_{ij}$ is the point
on $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ that is equidistant from $v_0,v_j,v_k$,
with $j,k$ distinct subscripts.  By an explicit calculation,
the barycentric coordinates of $w_{23}$, we find that
   $$w_{23} = t_1 v_1 + t_2 v_2 + t_3 v_3,$$
%% Done in Mathematica, grep for GLQHFGH.
where $$t_1 = \frac{x_{23} (x_{02} + x_{03} - x_{23})}{\Delta_{(01)}(x_{ij})}.$$
Since $w_{23}\in\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$, the sign is non-negative.
Also, the numerator is positive, by the edge-length constraints
$4\le x_{ij} < 8$.  Thus, $\Delta_{(01)}(x_{ij}) > 0$.
Again, by Lemma~\tref{tarski:bounded-tri}, $w_{23}$ is on the `positive'
side of the line in $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ formed by the plane
equidistant from $v_0$ and $v_1$.  That is,
   $$|w_{23}-v_0|^2 - |w_{23}-v_1|^2 > 0.$$
Computing this quantity using barycentric coordinates for $w_{23}$
with respect

   -\chi(x_{01},x_{02},x_{03},x_{23},x_{13},x_{12})/{\Delta_{(01)}(x_{ij})} >0.$$
Thus, $\chi < 0$, and the orientation is negative.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:decouple-orient}
Let $S=\{w,v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ be a packing of four points.
Assume that
   $$
   |v_0-v_1| < \sqrt8,\quad |v_0-v_2| < \sqrt8,\quad |v_1-v_2| < \sqrt8.
   $$
Suppose that there exists a point $x\in\ring{R}^3$
such that 
  $\op{conv}\{x,w\}$ meets $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$.  
Assume furthermore that
  $$
  |x-v_0| < |x-v_1|,\quad 
  |x-v_0| < |x-v_2|,\quad
  |x-w| < |x-v_0|;
  $$
that is, $x\in\Omega(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})\cap \Omega(w,\{v_0\})$.
%Then $w$ has nonpositive orientation with respect to $\{w,v_0,v_1,v_2\}$.
Then $\op{conv}(x,w)$ meets $F=\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proved} 
Assume for a contradiction that $\op{conv}(x,w)$ meets $\op{cone}$,
but not $F$.  Let $A = \op{aff}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ and $A^-=\op{aff}+-(\{v_0,v_1,v_2\},w)$
be the half-space bounded by $A$ not containing $w$. 
Let $P$
be the plane orthogonal to $A$ containing the line $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$.
Let $P^+$ be the half-space bounded by $P$ containing $v_0$.  Let
$P^-$ be the complementary half-space.

We note that $\Omega(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$ is a subset of $P^+$.  Since
$v_0,v_1,v_2\in A$ and $P$ is orthogonal to $A$, this reduces to
a calculation in in plane $A$.  In the plane $A$ it follows from
the fact that the triangle $\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ is not obtuse.  So $x\in P^+$.

If $w\in P^+$, then $\op{conv}\{x,w\}\subset P^+$, and
$P^+\cap \op{cone} \subset F$.  The result follows in this case.
We take $w\in P^-$.  Since $|v_1-v_2|<\sqrt8$, 
this implies that $P^+\cap A^-\cap \Omega(w,\{v_1,v_2\})$
is empty.  This contradicts the assumption that $x$ belongs to this
intersection.
%
%% (This proof is a minor adaptation of \cite[Lemma~2.2]{part2}.)
%Let $F=\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ and $C(F) = \op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$.
%
%Consider the set $X$ containing $x$ and bounded by the planes
%$H_1$ through $\{v_0,v_1,w\}$, $H_2$ through $\{v_0,v_2,w\}$,  $H_3$
%through $\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$, $H_4 = \{x: x\cdot v_1 = v_1\cdot
%v_1/2\}$, and $H_5 = \{x: x\cdot v_2 = v_2\cdot v_2/2\}$.  The
%planes $H_4$ and $H_5$ contain the 
%bounding faces of $\Omega(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$. The plane $H_3$
%contains the triangle $F$. The planes $H_1$ and $H_2$ bound the
%set containing points, such as $x$, that can be connected to $w$
%by a segment that passes through $C(F)$.
%
%We define a half-space $P$ by
%  $$
%  P = \{x \mid |x-w| < |x-v_0|\}.
%  $$ 
%The choice of $w$ implies
%that $X\cap P$ is nonempty. We leave it as an exercise to check
%that $X\cap P$ is bounded.  If the intersection of a bounded
%polyhedron with a half-space is nonempty, then some vertex of the
%polyhedron lies in the half-space.  Thus, some vertex of $X$ lies
%in $P$.
%
%We claim that the vertex of $X$ lying in $P$ cannot lie on $H_1$.
%To see this, pick coordinates $(x_1,x_2)$ on the plane $H_1$ with
%origin $v_0=0$ so that $v_1 = (0,z)$ (with $z>0$) and
% $X\cap H_1\subset X':=\{(x_1,x_2) : x_1\ge 0, \ x_2\le z/2\}$.
%If the quadrant $X'$ meets $P$, then the point $v_1/2$ lies in
%$P$. This is impossible, because every point between $0$ and $v_1$
%lies in the Voronoi cell at $0$ or $v_1$, and not in the Voronoi
%cell of $w$. (Recall that for every point $v_1$ on a barrier at
%the origin, $|v_1|<\sqrt8$.)
%
%Similarly, the vertex of $X$ in $P$ cannot lie on $H_2$.  Thus,
%the vertex must be the unique vertex of $X$ that is not on $H_1$
%or $H_2$, namely, the point of intersection of $H_3$, $H_4$, and
%$H_5$. This point is the circumcenter $c$ of the face $F$.  We
%conclude that the polyhedron $X_0:= X\cap P$ contains $c$. Since
%$c\in X_0$, the point $w$ has nonpositive
%orientation.

Moreover, $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}(x,w)$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proved}
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:decouple-orient}, $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{x,w\}$ at some point $y$.
We have $x\in\bar\Omega(S,w)$.  The point $y$ lies in $\Omega(S,w)$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:vor-bar},
the orientation of $w$ in $S$ is negative.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:vor-bar-quad}, $|w-v_i|\le 2.51$, for
$i=0,1,2.$.
%By Lemma~\tref{tarski:decouple-orient}, $w$ has negative orientation

%By

%we have
%  $$|w-v_i|\le 2.51,\text{ for } i=1,2,3.$$
%
%We adopt the notation $H_i$ from the proof of
%Lemma~\tref{tarski:decouple-orient}.
%Let $c$ be the circumcenter of the triangle $F=\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ and
%let $c_2$ be the circumcenter of the simplex $\{v_0,v_1,v_2,w\}$.
%Let $C=\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1/2,v_2/2,c,c_2\}$.  The set
%$C$ contains the set of points separated from $w$ by the
%half-plane $H_3$, closer to $w$ than to $v_0$, and closer to $v_0$
%than both $v_1$ and $v_2$. The point $x$ lies in
%$C$. Since $C$ is nonempty, the simplex $S$ has
%negative orientation along the face $\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$.
%
%Assume for a contradiction that $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$

%The set $C'$ of points $y\in C$ such that 
%  $\op{conv}(F)$ does not meet $\op{conv}\{y,w\}$ is thus
%nonempty. The set $C'$ must include the extreme point $c_2$ of
%$C$. This means that the plane $\{w,v_1,v_2\}$ separates $c_2$
%from $v_0$, so that the simplex $Q$ has negative orientation

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:dcg-page82}
Let $S=\{v_0,v_1,w_0,w_1\}$ be a packing of four points.
Assume that the circumradius of $S$ is $r\ge \sqrt2$.  Assume
that $S$ is not coplanar.   Assume
that the circumradius of $F=\{v_0,v_1,w_0\}$ is
  $\eta < \sqrt2$.   Let $c_0$ be the circumcenter of $F$.
Let $c_1$ be the point whose distances from $v_0,v_1$, and $w_0$ are
all exactly $\sqrt2$ and which lies in
$\op{aff}^0_+(F,w_2)$.
Let $F'=\{v_0,v_1,w_1\}$.  Assume that at least one of
the following
properties holds.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The circumradius of $F'$ is less than $\sqrt2$.
  \item $F'=\{u,v,w\}$ with $|u-v| \le 2.51$, $|v-w|\le 2.51$,
        $|u-w|\le\sqrt8$. Also, $|w_0-u|>2.51$ for some $u\in F'$.
\end{itemize}

Then $e=\op{conv}\{c_0,c_1\}$ does not
meet $\op{aff}(F)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}   We note that the point $c_1$ exists 
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:rog-exist}.

Assume for a contradiction that they meet.
The circumcenter $c_S$ of $S$ lies on
the line $\op{aff}\{c_0,c_1\}$ (through $e$) at a
distance $r$ from each point in $F$.  
Since $\eta < \sqrt2$, the orientation of $w_1$ is positive
with respect to $S$ (by Lemma~\tref{tarski:sqrt2-chi-plus}). 
Thus, $c_S$ lies along
the ray emanating from $c_0$ through $c_1$.  

This implies that $\op{conv}\{c_0,c_S\}$ meets $\op{aff}(F)$.
This in turn implies that $w_0$ has nonpositive orientation with
respect to $S$.  Again, by Lemma~\tref{tarski:sqrt2-chi-plus}, the
circumradius of $F'=\{v_0,v_1,w_1\}$ is at least $\sqrt2$.
If the orientation is
nonpositive, then 
   $$|w_0-u|\le 2.51,\quad\text{ for all } u\in F'$$
by Lemmas~\tref{tarski:neg-orient-quad} and

Let $S=\{v_0,v,w,w'\}$ be a packing of four points.
Suppose that

   %% second 2.51 was 2.77.
   $$
and the other four pairs in $S$ have separation at most $2.51$.
Let $c\le \rad_V(S)$.
Then $\op{rog}^0(v_0,w,v,w',c)$ is contained in
$\op{conv}^0(v_0,w,v,w')$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  Since $c\le \rad_V(S)$, we have
  $$
  \op{rog}^0(v_0,w,v,w',c)\subset \op{rog}^0(v_0,w,v,w',\rad_V(S)).
  $$
So it is enough to prove the result when $c=\rad_V(S)$.
The vertices of $\op{rog}^0$ are the circumcenter of $S$ and points
on $\op{conv}\{v_0,w,v\}$.
Since $|w-w'|> 2.51$, we see that the orientation of each face
of $\{v_0,v,w,w'\}$ is positive (Lemma~\ref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}).   It follows that the circumcenter
and hence all
the vertices of $\op{rog}^0$ lie in $\op{conv}^0(v_0,w,v,w')$.
The result follows.

Use barycentric coordinates to write

with $t_2,t_4,s_2,s_4\ge 0$,
for any $x\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_3\},\{v_2,v_4\})$. 
This final expression for $x$ holds only if $t_2>0$. 
Let $r=t_2s_4-s_2t_4$.  
Note $t_2>0$ and $r<0$ imply $t_4\ge0$. In fact, we find that the following
three cases exhaust the possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_2>0$ and $r\ge 0$,
\item $t_4>0$ and $r\le 0$,
\item $t_2=t_4=0$.

$x\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_3\},\{v_4,v_5\})$.
Similarly, in the second case,
$x\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_1,v_3\},\{v_2,v_5\}$.
Finally if $t_2=t_4=0$, then $v_5\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_3\}$, which is
contrary to hypothesis.  It follows that one of these two
conditions hold.  If both conditions hold, then $t_2,t_4>0$
and $t_2 s_4 - s_2 t_4 =0$, so that $s_2=s_4 = 0$.  This means
that $x\not\in\op{aff}^0$.

$$
  x = s_0 v_0 + s_1 v_1 + s_2 v_2 + s_4 v_4.

Since $v_4\in\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{v_1,v_2,v_3\})$, we have
$t_1<0$, $t_2<0$, $t_4>0$.  
We have $s_1\ge0,s_2\ge0$ if and only if $x\in A_{12}$.

We have $s_1\le0,s_1t_2\ge t_1s_2$ if and only if $x\in A_{23}$.
It is easily checked that these three conditions cannot simultaneously

If $x\in A_{12}\cap A_{13}$, then $s_2=0$, so $x\not\in\op{aff}_+^0(\{v_0,v_4\},\{v_1,v_2\})$.  The other cases are similar.

  $$

Let $p$ be the circumcenter of $S$.  Let $c_3$

Let 
   $$
   R = \op{rog}(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3,\rad_V(S)).

  \op{aff}^0_+(\{v_0,p\},\{v_1,c_3\}) \cap
  \Omega(v_0,S)
$$ 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
Let $w=(v_0+v_1)/2$.  We have $R=\op{conv}\{v_0,w,c_3,p\}$.
Write $C = \op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2,v_3\})$ and $C^0 = \op{cone}^0(\cdots)$.
By Lemma~\ref{tarski:hedra-tope}, 
   $$
   R=\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,p,c_3\},w)\cap \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,p,w\},c_3)\cap
   \op{aff}_+(\{p,w,c_3\},v_0)\cap \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,w,c_3\},p).
   $$
The intersection of the first two sets on the right is
$$
   \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,p\},\{c_3,w\}) = \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,p\},\{v_1,c_3\}).
$$
We have
$$
C = \cap_i \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_i,v_j\},v_k)
  \subset \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1,v_2\},v_3) = \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1,v_2\},p).
$$
Also,
$$
\Omega(S,v_0)\subset \Omega(\{v_1\},v_0) = \op{aff}_+^0(\{p,w,c_3\},v_0).
$$
The first claim follows.
A similar argument shows that
$$
 R^0 \supset C^0\cap
  \op{aff}_+^0(\{v_0,p\},\{v_1,c_3\}) \cap
  \Omega(S,v_0).
$$ 

In the other direction, assume that $x\in R^0$.
By the orientation constraints
$$
p\in \op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3\}\subset C.
$$
By the edge constraints,
$$
v_0,w,c_3\in \op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\}) \subset C.
$$
So $R=\op{conv}(p,v_0,w,c_3) \subset C$ and $R^0\subset C^0$.
As above,
$$
R^0 = \op{aff}^0_+(\{v_0,p\},\{c_3,w\}) \cap \cdots.
$$

We have 
$$R^0\subset \Omega(\{v_1\},v_0) = \op{aff}_+^+(\{p,w,c_3\},v_0)$$
and $$v_0,w,c_3,p\in \bar\Omega(\{v_2\},v_0)$$ so that $R^0\subset \Omega(\{v_2\},v_0)$.
Similarly, $$v_0,w,c_3,p\in \bar\Omega(\{v_3\},v_0)$$ so that $R^0\subset \Omega(\{v_3\},v_0)$.
Combining these inclusions gives the lemma.

$$
If $x'$ is equidistant from $u$ and $v$, then  $r_1t_1 + r_2 = r_1t_3$, or $1=r_1(t_2+2t_3)$, so $r_1>0$.
Thus, 
$$
x' = \lambda \frac{u+v}2 + (1-\lambda)x'',
$$
for some $0\le \lambda\le 1$.
This implies $x'\in\op{aff}_+^0(v,\{x\})$.  
Also, $|u-v|<\sqrt8$ implies $(u+v)/2\in\Phi(S,v,u)$.
As, $x''\in\Phi(S,v,u)$ and $\Phi$ is convex (Lemma~\ref{tarski:phi-convex}), we have 
$x'\in\op{conv}\{(u+v)/2,x''\}\subset\Phi(S,v,u)$.

Suppose that
$C=\op{cone}(v_2,\{v_1,v_3\})$ has a point $x$ with 
  $x\in\Phi(\{v_0,v_1,v_3\},v_2,v_0)$.    
Then $v_0$ has non-positive orientation in $S$.
\end{lemma}



\begin{proved} 
Let Let $P_{ij}$ be the plane equidistant from $v_i$ and
$v_j$ and let $L_{ij} = \op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}\cap P_{ij}$.
Let $L=L_{02}$.
The hypothesis implies that there exists a point 
$x'\in I \cap C$, where
   $$I= L\cap \{x'\mid |x'-v_2|\le|x'-v_1|,\ |x'-v_2|\le |x'-v_3|\}.$$  
The line $L$ meets either $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$ or $\op{aff}\{v_2,v_3\}$,
because it cannot be parallel to both.  Say $\op{aff}\{v_2,v_3\}$.
Since $|v_2-v_3|<\sqrt8$, the midpoint of $\{v_2,v_3\}$ is closer
to $v_2$ and $v_3$ than to $v_0$ by Lemma~\ref{tarski:mid-Voronoi}.
This implies that $I$ does not meet $\op{aff}\{v_2,v_3\}$.
We find that the intersection $w_{23}$ of the line $L$ with
the line $L_{23}$ lies in $\op{aff}_+^0(\{v_2,v_3\},v_1)$.  Similarly,
if $L$ meets $\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2\}$, then $L\cap L_{12}\subset\op{aff}_+^0(\{v_1,v_2\},v_3)$.  These points are the endpoints of 
$I$ (or one of them is, if $I$ is a ray).  It follows that $w_{23}\in C$.
This means that the barycenteric coordinates of $w_{23}=t_1v_1+\cdots t_3 v_3$ of $w_{23}$ satisfy
$t_i>0$.

We compute the barycentric coordinates of $w_{23}$ as in the proof
of Lemma~\ref{tarski:vor-bar}, to conclude that the orientation
of $v_0$ is non-positive.

  \item
  For some $u\in\{u_1,u_2\}$,
  $R$ meets $\op{cone}(v_0,\{w,u\})$.
  %
  \item  We have $|u_1-u_2|<\sqrt8$, 
  $v_1\in\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{w,u_1,u_2\})$, 
  $|v_1-u_1|\le 2.51$, and $|v_1-u_2|\le 2.51$.
  \item  We have $2.51<|u_1-u_2|<\sqrt8$, and 
  $w\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  
Note that $x\in\Phi(\{w,u_1,u_2\},v_0,v_1)$ never holds
on points of $R$, so we consider the set
$\Phi(\{w,u_1,u_2\},v_0,-)$ instead.

By Lemma~\ref{tarski:vor-bar-23}, the orientation
of $w$ in $S=\{v_0,w,u_1,u_2\}$ is non-positive.  This implies that
$|w-u_1|\le 2.51$ and  $|w-u_2|\le 2.51$, by
 Lemmas~\ref{tarski:neg-orient-tet} and~\ref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}. 


Assume first that 
$v_1\not\in \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,w\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.  
Thus, $v_1\in \op{aff}_-^0(\{v_0,w,u\},u')$, for $(u,u')=(u_1,u_2)$ or $(u_2,u_1)$.
If $R$ does not meet $P=\op{aff}\{v_0,w,u\}$, then this plane separates
$R$ from $F\subset \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,w\},\{u_1,u_2\})$, which contradicts
the hypotheses.  So $R$ meets $P$ (say at $y$).  
If $y'$ is the midpoint $(v_0+w)/2$, then
%projection of $y$ to the line $\op{aff}\{v_0,w\}$, then
$y' + t (y - y')\in R\cap P$, for $0<t<1$.  Choosing $t$ sufficiently
small, we get $y'\in R\cap \op{cone}(v_0,\{w,u\})$.
This is the first of the possibilities enumerated in the statement
of the lemma.


Now assume that
$v_1\in \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,w\},\{u_1,u_2\})$. 
Either $\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{w,v_1\})$ meets $\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{u_1,u_2\})$
or it does not.  If not, then
$v_1\not\in\op{conv}\{v_0,w,u_1,u_2\}$ by Lemma~\ref{tarski:v-interior}.
By barycentric coordinate considerations, $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1\}$ meets $\{w,u_1,u_2\}$.
If $2.51 < |u_1-u_2|$, then by hypothesis $|v_0-u_1|,|v_0-u_2|\le 2.51$.  Also, by
Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}, we have $|v_1-u_1|,|v_1-u_2|\le 2.51$.  This falls into the second case
of the conclusion.  If $|u_1-u_2|\le 2.51$, then by Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE} % 2^3 2.51^3 2^3
we have $|v_0-u_1|,|v_0-u_2|\le 2.51$.  Also, $|v_1-u_1|,|v_1-u_2|\le 2.51$.  Again,
this falls into the second case of the conclusion.

Finally, assume $\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{w,v_1\})$ meets $\op{cone}^0(v_0,\{u_1,u_2\})$.
The signs of the barycentric coordinates are such that $w\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.
Lemma~\tref{tarski:over-under} implies that $\op{conv}\{w,v_1\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,u_1,u_2\}$ 
(which is ruled out by Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}), or that $\op{conv}\{u_1,u_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,w,v_1\}$,
which implies (by Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}) that $|u_1-u_2|>2.51$.  Thus, we are in the third case of the conclusion.



 
%By Lemma~\ref{tarski:consec-anchors}, we have $2.51<|u_1-u_2|$.
%The hypotheses of the lemma give $|v_0-u_1|,|v_0-u_2|\le 2.51$.
% Moreover, the
%estimates $|v_1-u_1|\le 2.51$ and $|v_1-u_2|\le 2.51$ hold
%by Lemma~\ref{tarski:pass-anchor}.  % E().
%
%If they meet, by Lemma~\ref{tarski:quad-types}, we have that
%the signs of the barycentric coordinates are such that
%$w\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.  This completes the proof.

   %it has distance at least $2$ from $v_0,v_1,u_1,u_2$, 
   and 
   $|w'-v_0|,|w'-v_1|\le 2.51$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} \FIXX{recheck proof}
Set 
$A_\pm=\op{aff}_\pm(\{v_0,v_1,w\},p)$. Then $R^0\subset A_+$.
Let $S'=\{v_0,v_1,w,u_1\}$.  
We separate the proof into two cases, according to $u_1\in A_\pm$.

Assume that $u_1\subset A_-$.  If $S'$ is planar, then let
$y\in\op{aff}_+^0(v_0,\{v,w\})$ be the projection of $x$ to $\op{aff}(S')$.
$$y\in\Phi(\{v_1,w,u_1,u_2\},v_0,u_1)\subset\Phi(\{w,v_1\},v_0,u_1).$$
However, it is easily checked that
$$\op{aff}_+^0(v_0,\{v,w\}) \cap \Phi(\{w,v_1\},v_0,u_1) =\emptyset.$$
Hence $S'$ is not planar.

Let $c$ be the circumcenter of $S'$.  If $T\subset S'$ has three elements, let $L(T)$
be the line (of Lemma~\tref{tarski:line-lem}) equidistant from the points of $T$.
Let $L_+(T)\subset L(T)$ be the ray with endpoint $c$.  
%For any nonzero vertices $v',v''$,
%Let $L(v',v'')$ be the line of points equidistant from $\{v_0,v',v''\}$.
%The three lines $L(u,v)$, $L(v,w)$, $L(u,w)$ meet at the circumcenter
%$c$ of $S'$.  The rays $L^+(u,v)$, $L^+(v,w)$, $L^+(u,w)$ demarcate
%the regions between $x\in\Phi(\{w,u,v\},v_0,p)$, for $p=w,u,v$.  
(Pick the direction
of ray so that it runs through the circumcenter of the face $T$
if the remaining vertex has positive orientation, and so that it
runs in the opposite direction otherwise.)

If $u_1$ has positive orientation in $S'$, then $L_+\{v_0,v_1,w\}$ runs through
the circumcenter of $\{v_0,v_1,w\}$ and along an edge of $R^0$.
The extreme point $(v_0+w)/2$ of  $R^0$ also lies in $\Phi(\ldots,w)$.
It follows that $R^0\subset \Phi(\ldots,w)\setminus\Phi(\ldots,u_1)$, which is contrary
to our assumption.

Thus, $u_1$ has negative orientation in $S'$.  
This implies that $|u_1-v_1|,|u_1-w_1|,|u_1-v_0|\le 2.51$ (by Lemma~\ref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}).  
In particular,
$S'$ is a quarter.  Let $x'$ be the element associated with $x$ in Definition~\ref{def:Phi}. 
By Lemma~\ref{tarski:tip-cone}, we have
that $x'\in \op{cone}(u_1,\{v_1,w,v_0\})$.  As $x,x'\in F = \op{cone}(v_0,\{u_1,u_2\})$, it follows that 
in barycentric coordinates:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
x' &= t_0 v_0 + t_1 u_1 +t_2 u_2,\quad t_1,t_2\ge0,\quad \sum t_i = 1.\\
   &= s_1 u_1 + s_2 v_1 + s_3 w + s_0 v_0,\quad s_0,s_2,s_3\ge 0,\quad \sum s_i = 0.\\
t_2 u_2 &= (s_1-t_1) u_1 + s_2 v_1 + s_3 w + (s_0-t_0) v_0.
\end{array}
$$
If $t_2\ne 0$, then $u_2\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,u_1\},\{v_1,w\})$.
This falls within the first case of the lemma.
If $t_2=0$, then $S'$ is planar, which has already been treated.

%%WW MOVE THIS BACK TO FINE.TEX
%Since it has the same diagonal as a quarter in
%the $Q$-system, we have that $S$ is in the $Q$-system, so that
%$\{v_0,v,w\}$ is a barrier.  By Lemma~{tarski:tip-cone}, we have
%that $x\in \op{cone}(u,\{v,w,v_0\})$.  In particular, $x$ is obstructed
%from $u$ by the barrier $\{v,w,v_0\}$.  Take $w'=w$ in this case.

Now assume that $u_1\in A_+$.
First assume additionally that
$\rad_V(S')\ge b$ and that
the orientation of $u_1$ is non-positive in $S'$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}, it
follows that we are in the second case of the lemma.  
%By the rule
%for constructing crown tuples, there is no $R^0$ along $\{v_0,v,w\}$
%in this case.  

Next assume additionally that
$\rad_V(S')\ge b$ and the orientation of $u_1$ is positive
in $S'$.  The ray $L_+\{v_0,v_1,w\}$ runs along the edge of 
$R^0$ as before, and we cannot have $x\in\Phi(\ldots,u_1)$.
%see that $\Phi_0=w$ on $R^0$.

Finally assume additionally that $\rad_V(S')<b$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:eta-rad},
$$
\eta_V(v_0,v_1,u_1)\le \rad_V(S') < b = \eta(y,2,2.51).
$$
By the monotonicity of the circumradius (Lemma~\tref{tarski:eta:mono}), we have $|v_1-u_1|,|v_0-u_1|\le 2.51$.
%It follows that $u_1$ is an anchor of $\{v_0,v_1\}$.
Definition~\tref{def:split} gives three conditions that $w'$ satisfies.
From $|w'-w|\ge 2.77$ and $\rad_V\{v_0,v_1,w,w'\} \ge b$,
it follows that $x\in \op{aff}_-(\{v_0,v_1,w'\},u_1)$.  
The point $x'\in F\cap R^0$ lies in $\bar\Omega(u_1,S') \cap \op{aff}_-(\{v_0,v_1,w'\},u_1)$.
This implies that the orientation of $u_1$ is $\{v_0,v_1,w',u_1\}$ is negative, and Lemma~\ref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}
implies that $|u_1-w'|\le 2.51$.
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:tip-cone}, we have $x\in\op{cone}(u_1,\{v_0,v_1,w'\})$.

As $x'\in F$, this implies that $u_2\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,u_1\},\{v_1,w'\})$ (by an examination of
barycentric coordinates).  This shows that $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,w'\})$ meets $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,u_2\})$ and
that $w'\in \op{aff}(\{v_0,v_1\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.

By barycentric coordinates, either $u_2\in\op{cone}(u_1,\{v_0,v_1,w'\})$ or $w'\in\op{cone}(v_1,\{v_0,u_1,u_2\})$.
The second disjunct is not possible by Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE} (since $|v_1-w'|\le 2.51$).
So $u_2\in\op{cone}(u_1,\{v_0,v_1,w'\})$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE} again, this gives 
  $$
  |u_2-v_1|, |u_2-v_0|\le 2.51.
  $$
By Lemmas~\tref{tarski:cross} and~\tref{tarski:face}, $w'\not\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},u_2)$.
Similarly, $w'\not\in\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},u_1)$.  Thus, $w'\in\op{aff}_+^0(\{v_0,v_1\},\{u_1,u_2\})$.
It follows that we are in the third case of the lemma.
%By Lemma~\ref{tarski:prev},
%$\op{conv}\{x,u_1\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,w'\}$, and
% $|u-w'|\le 2.51$.  In particular $S'=\{v_0,v,w',u\}$ is
%an upright quarter and $\{v_0,v,w'\}$ is a barrier.

  $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,w'\}$.
\item $|u-w'|\le 2.51$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} 
Let $x\in R'$. Set $S'=\{v_0,v,w,w'\}$ and $Q=\{v_0,v,w',u\}$.
Let $x'$ be the point associated with $x$ in the definition of $\Phi$.  It satisfies
 $|x'-u|=|x'-v_0|$.  By the definition of $\Phi$,
$|x'-u| \le |x'-w|$.  The orientation of $w'$ in $S'$ is positive by Lemma~\tref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}.
Since $\rad_V(S')\ge\eta(2,2.51,|v-v_0|)$, we have
$|x'-u|=|x'-v_0| \le |x-v|,|x-w'|$.  Thus, $x'$ is at least as close to $u$
as any of the other vertices of $Q$.  Also, $x'$
and $u$ lie on opposite sides of the plane $\op{aff}\{v_0,v,w'\}$
(again because of the condition on $\rad_V(S')$).  Thus, $u$ has
negative orientation in $Q$ by Lemma~\tref{tarski:vor-bar}.  This forces 
$|u-w'|\le 2.51$ by Lemma~\tref{tarski:cm5-small}.

We have that $x'\in\bar\Omega(u,Q)$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:tip-cone},
we have that $x'\in\op{cone}(u,\{v_0,v,w'\})$.  This completes

This holds strictly in the sense that it lies in the complement of $\Phi(\{v_1,w_1,v_1'\},v_0,v_1')$.  
The sets $\Phi$ separate
$\op{rog}^0$ from $\op{rcone}$, so they are disjoint.

\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
Let $x$ be a point in the intersection of $\op{rog}^0(v_0,w_1,v_1,p_1,b_1)$ 
with $\op{rog}^0(v_0,w_2,v_2,p_2,b_2)$.  Up to renaming indices and perturbing $x$,
we may assume that
$x\in\Phi(\{w_1,w_2\},v_0,u)$ for $u=w_2$ but not for $u=w_1$.  
Let $S=\{v_0,v_1,w_1,w_2\}$.
We choose the index $i=1$.

We have $|v_1-w_2|\le 2.51$. 
Otherwise
the orientation of $S$ at $w_2$ is positive (Lemma~\tref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}).  In this case, 
  $\rad_V S \ge \eta(2,2.51,|v_1-v_0|)$ implies 
$x\in\Phi(\{v_0,v_1,w_1,w_2\},v_0,w_1)$, which is contrary to hypothesis.  

We will say that $w_1$ points {\it inward} if
     $$
     \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1,w_1\},w_2) = \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1,w_1\},p_1),
     $$
and outward otherwise.

If $|w_1-w_2|> 2.51$, then the orientation of $w_2$ in $S$ is positive (Lemma~\tref{tarski:neg-orient-quad}).
We have $\rad_V(S) < \eta(2,2.51,|v_1-v_0|)$, for otherwise
$x\in\Phi(\ldots,w_1)$.   Also, $w_1$ points inward, for otherwise
$x\in\Phi(\ldots,w_1)$.  This is the third case of the conclusion.

Now take $|w_1-w_2|\le 2.51$. 
We assume that the second case of the conclusion does not hold and prove that
the first case holds.  Thus, we assume that $w_1$ points outward.
By the definition of $\Phi$, there exists $x'$ such
that 
$$|x' - w_2|=|x'-v_0| < |x'-w_1|,\ |x'-v_1|.$$
%Generally, the inequality is not strict here, but by perturbing the initial
%choice of $x$ as we have, we may assume it is strict.
%For $t'>t$ sufficiently small, and setting $u' = v_0 + t'(x-v_0)$, we
%have
%$$
%  |u - w_2| < |u-v|, \text{ for } v = v_0,w_1,v_1.
%$$
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:tip-cone}, we have
$$
  x' \in \op{aff}_+(w_2,\{v_0,w_1,v_1\}).
$$
Also, $x \in\op{aff}_+(w_2,\{v_0,w_1,v_1\})$.
%$$
%     H=\op{aff}^0_-(\{v_0,v_1,w_1\},w_2) = \op{aff}^0_+(\{v_0,v_1,w_1\},p_1);
%%     $$
%The dihedral angle $\dih_V(\{v_0,w_1\},\{v_1,w_2\}) < \pi/2$ (justified by
%the arguments of Section~\ref{sec:trig}),\FIWW{Counterexample:
%$\dih(2.51, 2.51, 2, 2.51, 2, 2) > \pi/2$.  Need to fix this, perhaps with interval calculations.}
%so its complementary
%angle is greater than $\pi/2$.  The dihedral angle of $R_1=\op{rog}^0(v_0,w_1\ldots)$
%along $\{v_0,w_1\}$ is less than $\pi/2$.  Thus, $R_1$ is contained in
%$A=\op{aff}_+^0(\{v_0,w_2\},\{v_1,w_1\})$.  In particular, $x\in A$.
%Our assumption gives  $x \in R_1 \subset H$.  
Also, $R_2 = \op{rog}^0(v_0,w_2,\ldots)$
is convex, contains $x$, and extends to $y=(v_0+w_2)/2$.  
The plane
$$P  =\op{aff}\{v_0,v_1,w_1\}$$ separates $x$ from $y$.  The point $z$
of intersection of $\op{conv}\{x,y\}$ with $P$ lies in
   $$R_2 \cap \op{aff}_+(v_0,\{v_1,w_1\}),$$
as claimed by the lemma.

perturb $\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ along its remaining degree of freedom

If $\op{conv}\{v_3,v_4\}$ meets

\begin{proved}
Suppose the figure exists with $|v_3-v_4|\le\sqr8$. Label vertices
so $v_3$ lies on the same side of the figure as $v_1$. Contract
$\{v_3,v_4\}$ by moving $v_3$ and $v_4$ until
    $\{v_i,u\}$ has length $2$,
for $u=v_0,v_5,v_{i-2}$, and $i=3,4$. Lemma~\tref{tarski:face} shows that the incidence constraints are preserved.
Pivot $v_5$ away from $v_3$ and
$v_4$ around the axis $\{v_1,v_2\}$ until
    $|v_5-v_0|=\sqr8$.  Lemma~\tref{tarski:cross} shows that the incidence constraints are preserved.
Contract $\{v_3,v_4\}$ again. By stretching $\{v_1,v_2\}$, we
obtain a square of edge two and vertices $\{v_0,v_3,v_5,v_4\}$. Short
calculations based on explicit formulas for the dihedral angle and
its partial derivatives give
    $$

\end{lemma}

%(That, is the figure is an octahedron.)

\begin{proved}  Let $x\in I\cap C$.
By Lemma~\ref{tarski:small-edge-conv0}, if the sets meet, they
meet at a point in $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.
Assume for a contradiction that the sets meet at $x$.
We cannot have $w,w'\in C$ by
Lemma~\tref{tarski:v-interior}.  So the endpoints $w,w'$ of $I$
lie outside $C$.
The segment $I$ does not meet an edge $\op{conv}\{v_i,v_j\}$
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:cross}.  So the segment $I$ meets
two different faces of $C$, one on entry and another on exit.
By the definition of small face and Lemma~\ref{tarski:XX}, % small-eta 
each of these two faces has at most
one edge of length greater than $2.51$.  

Suppose that the set $W = W_1$ of two points in $S$ 
shared by these two faces has length greater
than $2.51$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face}, 
we reach a contradiction $|w-w'|>\sqrt8$.
So the edge $W$ has length at most $2.51$.

Let $W_2 = \{v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3\}\setminus W$ be the
edge opposite the shared edge.  We can decrease $|w-w'|$, contracting
along $W_2$ until the length of $W_2$ is $2$.  The assumptions now allow
us to label the vertices so that $W_2=\{v_1,v_2\}$, and so
that
$W=\{v_0,v_3\}$ (as we see by running through
all possibilities).  Increase the dihedral angle
of the simplex along $\{v_1,v_2\}$ until $|v_0-v_3|=2.51$.

Fix $S$ and contract along $\{w,w'\}$

  $$
  |u-v_i| = 2,\quad (u,i)=(w,0),(w,3),(w,1), (w',0), (w',3),(w',2).

The projections of $w$ and $v_2$ to the plane $A=\op{aff}(v_0,v_3,v_1)$
lie in $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,v_3,v_1\}$ (because the appropriate dihedral

$v_1$ in the plane $A$, preserving constraints,

Similarly, we move $v_2$  until $|v_0-v_2|=\sqrt8$ and $|v_3-v_2|=2.51$.

We arrive at a rigid figure that satisfies all the constraints.
Pick coordinates and compute $|w-w'| > \sqrt8$, a contradiction.

\begin{proved} By Lemma~\tref{tarski:XX},%Lemma 132bis of handwritten notes on SVN:133 copy. 
we may assume that $I$ meets $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,\ldots,v_3\}$. As in the proof of Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6-not},
the segment $I$ meets
two different faces of $C$, one on entry and another on exit.
By the definition of small, each of these two faces has at most
one edge of length greater than $2.51$ (Lemma~\ref{tarski:double-face}).  Furthermore, the edge
shared by these two faces has length less than $2.51$.  We may
label it $\{v_0,v_1\}$, so that $I$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$
and $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_3\}$.   The circumradius
of each face crossed by $I$ is at least $\sqrt2$.
Since the faces are small,
we have $|v_0-v_1|,|v_1-v_2|,|v_0-v_3|\le 2.51$.  

Applying Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-anchor}
to both of these faces, we get that 
   $$
   |u-v_i|\le 2.51,\quad u=w,w',\quad i=0,1,2,3.
   $$
We have $|w-w'|\ge 2.51$, by Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}.
%
%% WW CUT BECAUSE IT RELATES TO LONGER THM STATEMENT.
%Suppose that the edge $\{w_1,w_2\}$
%shared by these two faces has length greater
%than $2.51$.  By Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face}, 
%we reach a contradiction $|w-w'|>\sqrt8$.
%So the edge $\{w_1,w_2\}$ has length at most $2.51$.
%It is readily checked using the classification of Lemma~\tref{tarski:quad-types},
%that $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_3\})$ meets $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_2.v_4\})$

%$\op{quadp}(w,(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3))$ and similarly,
%$\op{quadp}(w',(v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3))$.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:tri-tri-6}
% New lemma, not in DCG. \tlabel{tarski:two-face}
Let $S=\{v_0,v_1,v_2,w_0,w_1,w_2\}$ be a packing of six points. 
Suppose that the triangles $\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ and $\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$
are small.  Suppose that $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ meets
$\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$ at $x$.  Then after reindexing
($\{v'_0,v'_1,v'_2\}=\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$, $\{w'_0,w'_1,w'_2\} = \{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$),
we have 
   $$
   \begin{array}{lll}
   |v'_0-v'_1|\le 2.51,\quad |v'_1-v'_2|\le 2.51,\quad 2.51 < |v'_0-v'_2|<\sqrt8,\\
   |w'_0-w'_1|\le 2.51,\quad |w'_1-w'_2|\le 2.51,\quad 2.51 < |w'_0-w'_2|<\sqrt8.
   \end{array}
   $$
Furthermore, $\op{conv}\{v'_0-v'_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$
and  $\op{conv}\{w'_0-w'_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$.
Furthermore, these are the only incidences of edge with face.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved} We have $x\not\in S$.
It can be readily checked that $\op{aff}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}\ne
\op{aff}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$.  
Let $L$ be the line of intersection of the planes $\op{aff}$.
The line $L$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_2\}$ in an interval $I_v$
and $\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$ in an interval $I_w$.  We have
$x\in I_v\cap I_w$.  Some endpoint $y$ of one of the intervals lies
in $I_v\cap I_w$.  This implies that an edge, say $\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1\}$,
meets the other face $\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$.  
By Lemma~\tref{no-pass-sqrt2},
the circumradius of $\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$ is at least $\sqrt2$.  By
the definition of small face, the triangle $\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$
has at most one edge longer than $2.51$.

By Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}, we have $|v_0-v_1|>2.51$.  
$v_2$ lies in one of the three lunes
$$\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{w_1,w_2\})),\quad \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{w_2,w_3\}),\quad \op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{w_1,w_3\})$$
Say $\op{aff}_+(\{v_0,v_1\},\{w_1,w_2\})$.   We have $v_2\not\in\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,w_1,w_2\})$
because the edges $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,v_2\}$ 
and $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v_2\}$ are too short to meet
the face $\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$ (Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}).  Thus, $\op{cone}(v_0,\{v_1,v_2\})$ meets
$\op{cone}(v_0,\{w_1,w_2\})$.

By Lemma~\tref{tarski:over-under},%\FIWW{proj-coord.}
either $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ or
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,w_1,w_2\}$.
In the first case, we get that $|w_1-w_2|>2.51$, $|w_0-w_1|,|w_0-w_2|\le 2.51$ (by Lemma~\ref{tarski:EE}).
This is the situation described by the lemma.

We rule out the second case.  If 
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,w_1,w_2\}$,
then $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ also meets $\op{conv}\{w_0,w_1,w_2\}$.
However, $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ is too short for that (Lemma~\ref{tarski:EE}).  Thus,
this case does not occur.

Let $S_V = \{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ and $S_W=\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$.  Assume
that the sets $S_W$ and $S_V\setminus\{v_i\}$ are small for
$i=1,2,3,4$.
Then $C_V=\op{conv}(S_V)$ is disjoint from $C_W=\op{conv}(S_W)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  Let $x$ be in the intersection.
Let $L$ be any line through $x$ with $L\subset \op{aff}(S_W)$.  $L$ meets $C_V$ in an interval
$I_V$ and $C_W$ in an interval $I_W$.  Pick an endpoint $z$
of $I_V$ or $I_W$ that lies in $I_V\cap I_W$.  

After reindexing, if $z$ is an endpoint of $I_V$, then
$z\in\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}\cap C_W$.  After reindexing, if $z$
is an endpoint of $I_W$, then $C_V$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$.

In the first case, $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ meets $C_V$.
This is the intersection of two small faces, which is described
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-6}.  With appropriate indexing, we have
$$
  |v_1-v_3|>2.51,\quad |w_1-w_3|>2.51.
$$
Also, $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\}$ meets $C_W$, since $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3\}$
does.  This is again, the situation of Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-6}.
This gives that $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\}$
(and $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$).  This is impossible by 
Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face}.

In the second case, $C_V$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$.  If $I$
meets $C_V^0$, then as in Lemma~\ref{tarski:lin-sim-6-not}, it
meets two faces of $V$, one on entry and one on exit.
In any case, $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$ meets a face of $C_W$ which
we may assume by reindexing to be $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.
This case then follows from the preceding case.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:tri-sim-6}
% NOT IN DCG, used to separate simplices, etc.
Let $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,w_2,w_3\}$ be a packing of six points.
Let $S_V = \{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ and $S_W=\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$, where $w_1=v_1$.  
Assume
that the sets $S_W$ and $S_V\setminus\{v_i\}$ are small for
$i=1,2,3,4$.
Let $C_V=\op{conv}(S_V)$ and $C_W=\op{conv}(S_W)$.
Assume that $C_V\cap C_W\ne \{v_1\}$.
Then, up to reindexing points, the incidence structure 
is described by either A or B.
\begin{itemize}
\item{A:} We have that $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$
and $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_4\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$.
Also, $|w_1-w_3|,|v_2-v_4|>2.51$,
$$
|v_2-v_3|, |v_3-v_4|, |w_1-w_2|, |w_2-w_3|\le 2.51$$ and
  $$
  |w_1-v_4|,|v_4-w_3|,|w_3-v_2|,|v_2-w_1|\le 2.51.
  $$
\item{B:} We have that $\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}(S_V\setminus\{v_i\})$ for two different indices $i=i_1,i_2$.  Furthermore,
$|v_2-v_4|,|v_1-v_3|>2.51$ and 
$|w_i-v_j|\le 2.51$, for $i=2,3$ and $j=1,2,3,4$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  Note that Case B states that we are in the context
of Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6} (with $I = \{w_2,w_3\}$).

Let $x\ne v_1$ be an element of $C_V\cap C_W$.  Let $L=\op{aff}\{x,v_1\}$.
Let $L\cap C_V = I_V$, $L\cap C_W = I_W$.  Pick an endpoint $z$ of $I_W$
or $I_V$ that lies in $I_W\cap I_V$.  
Up to reindexing, we have four possibilities, depending on whether
$z$ is an endpoint of $I_W$ or $I_V$ and on whether the facet containing
$z$ has $w_1=v_1$ as an extreme point or not.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Case 1: $z\in \op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}\cap C_W$.
  \item Case 2: $z\in C_V \cap \op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$.
  \item Case 3: $z\in C_V \cap \op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$, with $w\ne w_1$.
  \item Case 4: $z\in \op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}\cap C_W$, with $z\ne w_1$.
\end{itemize}
Start with Case~1.  This situation is described by 
Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-6}.  It states that there is a uniquely
determined pair $\{w_i,w_j\}$ such that $|w_i-w_j|>2.51$.
It follows by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-6}
that we are in situation A (after reindexing), provided $\{i,j\}\ne\{2,3\}$.
If $\{i,j\}=\{2,3\}$,  then by Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6-not} and Lemma~\ref{tarski:tri-tri-6}, the
set $\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ can be written $\{v_a,v_b\}\cup \{v_c,v_d\}$
with $|v_a-v_b|>2.51$ and $|v_c-v_d|>2.51$. 
(or $|v_2-v_4|,|v_1-v_3|>2.51$, after reindexing). The conditions of
Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6} are now satisfied, placing us in
situations B.

In Case~2, it follows from Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6-not} that
the hypotheses of Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6} hold.  It follows
from Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-6} that we are in situation B.

In Case~3, we have by Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-5} that $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2\}$
meets $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$. In particular $C_W$ meets
$\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  This situation was treated in Case~1.

In Case~4, by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-5}, we either have that $\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$
meets $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ (which was treated in Case~2),
or that $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$
(which was treated in Case~1).  This completes the proof.

\item B:  $\op{conv}\{v_3,v_4\}$ meets $C_W$ and $|v_3-v_4|>2.51$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
Let $x\in C_V\cap C_W$.  For a contradiction, assume that
$x\not\in\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$.  Let $L=\op{aff}\{x,v_1\}$.
Let $L\cap C_W = I_W$ and $L\cap C_V = I_V$.  Let $z$ be an endpoint
other than $v_1$
of $I_V$ or $I_W$ in $I_V\cap I_W$.  Then $z\not\in\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$. 
%Moreover, $x,z\not\in\op{aff}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\},\op{aff}\{v_1,v_2,v_4\}$. 
There are two possibilities, up to reindexing depending on whether
$z$ is an endpoint of $I_W$ or $I_V$.
Either $z\in \op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}\cap C_V$ or 
$z\in\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\}\cap C_W$.

In the first case, Lemma~\tref{tarski:lin-sim-5} gives that $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}$
meets $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  This is situation~A.  The estimate
$|w_1-w_3|>2.51$ follows from Lemma~\tref{tarski:EE}.

In the second case, there is a common vertex $v_1=w_1$.  We have
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-tri-5}, that either $\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$ meets
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\}$ or $\op{conv}\{v_3,v_4\}$ meets
$C_W$.  If the former holds, then swapping indices $1$ and $2$,
this is a case treated in Case~1.  If the latter holds, then
we are in situation B.  The estimate $|v_3-v_4|>2.51$ follows

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:sim-sim-7}
Let $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,w_2,w_3,w_4\}$ be a packing of seven
points.
Let $w_1=v_1$.
Assume that $\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}\setminus\{v_i\}$ and
$\{w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4\}\setminus\{w_i\}$ are small, for $i=1,2,3,4$.
Let 
   $C_W =\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4\}$ and
$C_V = \op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  
Then
  $$
  C_W \cap C_V = \{v_1\}.
  $$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}  Assume that $v_1\ne x\in C_W\cap C_V$.
Let $L=\op{aff}\{x,v_1\}$.  Let $z\in L\cap C_W\cap C_V$ be an endpoint
of one of the intervals $L\cap C_W$ or $L\cap C_V$.  Then, up
to reindexing, and the symmetry $v_i\leftrightarrow w_i$,  we have
that $z$
belongs to $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}\cap C_V$ or to
$\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3,w_4\}\cap C_V$.  The latter case is impossible
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-7}.  Hence,  
   $$z\in\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}\cap C_V.$$  This situation
is described by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-6}, which gives two cases (A)
and (B). 

In case~B of Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-6}, 
we have that $\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$
meets a face $\op{conv}\{v_i,v_j,v_k\}$ of $S_V$.  In particular,
$\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3,w_4\}$ meets $C_V$.  This is impossible
by Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-7}.

In case~A of Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-6}, we have that
$\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}$ meets $C_V$, and also (reindexing if necessary)
$\op{conv}\{v_2,v_4\}$ meets $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$.
Moreover, $|v_2-v_4|>2.51$ and $|v_3-v_2|,|v_4-v_3|\le 2.51$.
In particular, $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3,w_4\}$
meets $C_V$ at a point $x'\ne v_1$.  We apply Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-6} again, this
time to $\{w_1,w_3,w_4\}$ and $S_V$ to get that $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_4\}$ meets
$\{w_1,w_3,w_4\}$.  However, this contradicts Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face}.

%% DCG isolated pair.
Let $S=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,w_3,w_4\}$ be a packing of six points.
Let $w_i=v_i$, for $i=1,2$.  Let $S_V=\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$

Let $x\in (C_W\cap C_V)\setminus \op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$.
Let $L=\op{aff}\{v_1,x\}$.  Let $z$ be a point in 
$L\cap (C_W\cap C_V)\setminus\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$ that is
an endpoint of an interval $L\cap C_W$ or $L\cap C_V$.   Exchanging
$S_V$ and $S_W$ under the symmetry $v_i\leftrightarrow w_i$,
we may assume that $z$ is an endpoint of $L\cap C_W$.  
Then $\op{conv}\{w_i,w_j,w_k\}$ meets $C_V$, for some $i,j,k$.
Up to reindexing, 
we have two cases, according to the cardinality of
$\{i,j,k\}\cap\{1,2\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_4\}$ meets $C_V$ at $z\not\in \op{conv}\{v_1,v_2\}$.
  \item $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3,w_4\}$ meets $C_V$ at $z\ne v_1$.
\end{enumerate}

%The first case is treated in Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-5}.
%The second case is treated in Lemma~\tref{tarski:tri-sim-6}.

We treat the second case (2) first.  This case is covered
by Lemma~\ref{tarski:tri-sim-6}.  That lemma gives two
possibilities: $A$ or $B$.  If $A$, the result follows. Assume
$B$.  If $|v_1-v_3|, |v_2-v_1| > 2.51$, then $B'$ follows.
If $|v_1-v_2|, |v_3-v_4| > 2.51$, then $C'$ follows.
This completes the proof in the second case.

Now treat the first case (1).  This case is covered by
Lemma~\ref{tarski:tri-sim-5}, which gives a conclusion $A$ or $B$,
up to reindexing.
If $A$, then $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3\}$ meets $\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ and $|w_1-w_3|>2.51$.  In particular, $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_3,w_4\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.  This was treated in case (2).

If $B$, then $\op{conv}\{v_3,v_4\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_4\}$.  Then $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_3,v_4\}$ meets $C_W$.  This was treated in case (2), with $v_*$ and $w_*$ interchanged.  So case (1) reduces to case (1).

  \op{conv}\{w_1,w_4\} \text{ meets } \op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}.

\begin{remark}
Because of the conclusion,
we see that $S_V'=\{w_4,v_2,v_3,v_4\}$ also satisfies the
conditions of the lemma (if $S_V$ does). 
Also, because of the conclusion,
$S_W' = \{w_1,w_4,v_2,v_4\}$ and $S_W''=\{w_1,w_4,v_3,v_4\}$
satisfy the conditions of the lemma (on $S_W$); that is,
their faces are small, and so forth.
Again, by the conclusion, $S_W$, $S_W'$, and $S_W''$ are the
only three sets of four points in $\ring{R}^3$ that satisfy
the conditions of the lemma (with respect to 
$S_W$ for some fixed $S_V$).
\end{remark}

\begin{proved}
We have that $S_V\setminus\{v_i\}$ are
small for $i=1,2,3,4$.

Let $n$ be the cardinality of $S_W\cup S_V$.  By Lemmas~\tref{tarski:sim-sim-8}
and \tref{tarski:sim-sim-7}, we have $4\le n\le 6$.  When
$n=6$, Lemma~\tref{tarski:sim-sim-6} implies that $S_V$ has an edge
$|v_i-v_j|>2.51$, which is contrary to hypothesis.  So $n\le 5$.

Also, $n=4$ is contrary to the assumption~\tref{tarski:eqn:cap}. 
Hence $n=5$.  
Choose indices so that $w_i=v_i$, for $i=1,2,3$. 
This situation is treated by Lemma~\tref{tarski:sim-sim-5}.
That lemma gives that $|w_1-w_4|>2.51$ and that
  $\op{conv}\{w_1,w_4\}$ meets $\op{conv}\{v_2,v_3,v_4\}$.
This implies by Lemma~\tref{no-pass-sqrt2} that 
$\eta_V(v_2,v_3,v_4)\ge\sqrt2$.

By Lemma~\tref{tarski:qrtet-pair-pass}, we have that 
$$|w_j-v_i|\le 2.2,\quad i=2,3,4;\ j=1,4.$$
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:eta-2.2}, we have that 
 $$\eta_V(v_1,v_i,v_j) < \sqrt2,\quad 2\le i < j \le 4.$$
The conclusion follows.

\end{lemma}

The proof of this lemma will give valuable details about how the
interior of one strict quarter meets another.

\begin{proved}
Fix the origin at the base point of an adjacent pair of quarters.
We investigate the local geometry when the interior of another
quarter overlaps meets one of their interiors.  (This happens, for
example, when there is a conflicting diagonal.)
%Definition~\tref{def:corner}.


Label the base point of the pair of quarters $v_0$, and the four
corners  $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, with $\{v_1,v_3\}$ the common
diagonal. Assume that $|v_1-v_3|<\sqrt8$.\indy{Index}{conflicting
diagonals}

If two quarters share an interior point then a face on one of them
``overlaps'' a face on the other.  By
Lemmas~\tref{tarski:single-enclosed} and \tref{tarski:double-face}, we
actually have that some edge (in fact the diagonal) of each passes
through a face of the other.  This edge cannot exit through
another face by Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face} and it cannot end
inside the simplex by Lemma~\tref{tarski:v-interior}. Thus, it must
end at a vertex of the other simplex.  We break the proof into
cases according to which vertex of the simplex it terminates at.
In Case 1, the edge has the base point as an endpoint.  In Case 2,
the edge has a corner as an endpoint.

\noindent{\bf Case 1.} {\it The edge $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,w\}$ meets 
the
triangle $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$, where $\{v_0,w\}$ is a diagonal of a
strict quarter.}

Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-anchor} implies that $v_1$ and $v_3$ are
anchors of $\{v_0,w\}$. The only other possible anchors of $\{v_0,w\}$
are $v_2$ or $v_4$, for otherwise an edge of length at most $2.51$
passes through a face formed by $\{v_0,w\}$ and one of its anchors.
If both $v_2$ and $v_4$ are anchors, then we have a quartered
octahedron, which has been excluded by the hypotheses of the
lemma. Otherwise, $\{v_0,w\}$ has at most three anchors: $v_1$,
$v_3$, and either $v_2$ or $v_4$. In fact, it must have exactly
three anchors, for otherwise there is no quarter along the edge
$\{v_0,w\}$. So there are exactly two quarters along the edge
$\{v_0,w\}$. There are at least four anchors along $\{v_1,v_3\}$:
$0$, $w$, $v_2$, and $v_4$. The quarters along the diagonal
$\{v_1,v_3\}$ lie in the $Q$-system. (None of these quarters is
isolated.)  The other two quarters, along the diagonal $\{v_0,w\}$,
are not in the $Q$-system. They form an adjacent pair of quarters
(with base point $v_4$ or $v_2$) that has conflicting diagonals,
$\{v_0,w\}$ and $\{v_1,v_3\}$, of length at most $\sqr8$.

\noindent {\bf Case 2.}  {\it $\{v_2,v_4\}$ is a diagonal of
length less than $\sqr8$ (conflicting with $\{v_1,v_3\}$).}

(Note that if an edge of a quarter meets the shared face
of an adjacent pair of quarters, then that edge must be
$\{v_2,v_4\}$, so that Case 1 and Case 2 are exhaustive.) The two
diagonals $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v_3\}$ and $\op{conv}^0\{v_2,v_4\}$ 
do not meet. By
symmetry, we may assume that $\op{conv}^0\{v_2,v_4\}$ meets the face
$\op{conv}\{v_0,v_1,v_3\}$. Assume (for a contradiction) that both diagonals
have an anchor other than $0$ and the corners $v_i$. Let the
anchor of $\{v_2,v_4\}$ be denoted $v_{24}$ and that of
$\{v_1,v_3\}$ be $v_{13}$. Assume the figure is not a quartered
octahedron, so that $v_{13}\ne v_{24}$. By
Lemma~\tref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}, it is impossible to
draw the edges $\{v_1,v_{13}\}$ and $\{v_{13},v_3\}$ between $v_1$
and $v_3$.  In fact, if the edges pass outside the quadrilateral
$\{v_0,v_2,v_{24},v_4\}$, one of the edges of length at most $2.51$
(that is,
    $\{v_0,v_2\}$, $\{v_2,v_{24}\}$, $\{v_{24},v_4\}$,
or $\{v_4,0\}$) violates the lemma applied to the face
$\{v_1,v_3,v_{13}\}$. If they pass inside the quadrilateral, one
of the edges $\{v_1,v_{13}\}$, $\{v_{13},v_3\}$ violates the lemma
applied to the face
    $\{v_0,v_{2},v_4\}$ or $\{v_{24},v_2,v_4\}$.
We conclude that at most one of the two diagonals has additional
anchors.

If neither of the two diagonals has more than three anchors, we
have nothing more than two overlapping adjacent pairs of quarters
along conflicting diagonals.  The two quarters along the lower
edge $\{v_2,v_4\}$ lie in the $Q$-system.  Another way of
expressing this ``lower-edge'' condition is to require that the
two adjacent quarters $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ satisfy
$\dih_V(Q_1)+\dih_V(Q_2)>\pi$, when the dihedral angles are measured
along the diagonal. The pair $(Q_1',Q_2')$ along the upper edge
will have $\dih_V(Q_1')+\dih_V(Q_2')<\pi$.

If there is a diagonal with more than three anchors,  the quarters
along the diagonal with more than three anchors lie in the
$Q$-system.  Any additional quarters along the diagonal
$\{v_2,v_4\}$ belong to an adjacent pair. Any additional quarters
along the diagonal $\{v_1,v_3\}$ cannot intersect the adjacent
pair along $\{v_2,v_4\}$.  Thus, every quarter intersecting an
adjacent pair also belongs to an adjacent pair.

In both possibilities of case 2, the two quarters left out of the
$Q$-system correspond to a conflicting diagonal.

We have seen in the proof of Lemma~\tref{tarski:adj-over} that if
the interior of a strict quarter $Q$ meets the interior of a
strict quarter that is part of an adjacent pair, then $Q$ is also
part of an adjacent pair. Thus, if the interior of an isolated
strict quarter meets the interior of another strict quarter, then
both strict quarters are necessarily isolated.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:iso-over}\usage{DCG-[4.39]{ lemma:iso-over}}
If the interior of an isolated strict quarter $Q$ meets the
interior of another strict quarter, then the diagonal of $Q$ has
exactly three anchors.
\end{lemma}

The proof of the lemma will give detailed information about the
geometric configuration that is obtained when the interior of an
isolated quarter meets the interior of another strict quarter.

\begin{proved}  Assume that there are two strict quarters $Q_1$ and $Q_2$
that meet in their interiors.  Following Remark~\tref{tarski:iso},
assume that neither is adjacent to another quarter. Let $\{v_0,u\}$
and $\{v_1,v_2\}$ be the diagonals of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. Suppose the
diagonal $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,v_2\}$ meets a face $\op{conv}\{v_0,u,w\}$ of $Q_1$.
By Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-anchor}, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are anchors of
$\{v_0,u\}$. Again, either the length of $\{v_1,w\}$ is at most
$2.51$ or the length of $\{v_2,w\}$ is at most $2.51$, say
$\{w,v_2\}$ (by Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-makes-quarter}). It follows
that
    $Q_1=\{v_0,u,w,v_2\}$ and $|v_1-w|\ge2.51$.
($Q_1$ is not adjacent to another quarter.)  So $w$ is not an
anchor of $\{v_1,v_2\}$.

Let $\{v_1,v_2,w'\}$ be a face of $Q_2$ with $w'\ne v_0,u$. If
$\{v_1,w',v_2\}$ does not link $\{v_0,u,w\}$, then $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,w'\}$ or
$\op{conv}^0\{v_2,w'\}$ meets the face $\op{conv}\{v_0,u,w\}$, which is
impossible by Lemma~\tref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}. So
$\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,w'\}$  meets $\op{conv}\{v_0,u,w\}$
and an edge of $\op{conv}\{v_0,u,w\}$
meets the face $\op{conv}\{v_1,v_2,w'\}$. It is not the edge
$\{u,w\}$ or $\{v_0,w\}$, for they are too short by
Lemma~\tref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}.  So $\op{conv}^0\{v_0,u\}$ meets 
$\op{conv}\{w',v_1,v_2\}$. The only anchors of $\{v_1,v_2\}$ (other
than $w'$) are $u$ and $0$ (by Lemma~\tref{tarski:double-face}).
Either $\{u,w'\}$ or $\{w',0\}$ has length at most $2.51$ by
Lemma~\tref{tarski:pass-makes-quarter}, but not both, because this
would create a quarter adjacent to $Q_2$. By symmetry,
$Q_2=\{v_1,v_2,w',0\}$ and the length of $\{u,w'\}$ is greater
than $2.51$. By symmetry, $\{v_0,u\}$ has no other anchors either.
This determines the local geometry when there are two quarters
that intersect without belonging to an adjacent pair of quarters.
It follows that the two quarters form an isolated pair.

\begin{lemma}
%    \oldlabel{3.8.2}
Let $\{v_0,v\}$ be an upright diagonal with at least four anchors.
If $Q$ is a flat quarter such that $\op{conv}^0(Q)$  meets  
an interior point of 
a slice along $\{v_0,v\}$, then the vertices of $Q$ are the
origin and three consecutive anchors of $\{v_0,v\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
For there to be overlap, the diagonal $\op{conv}^0\{w_1,w_2\}$ of $Q$ 
must meet
 $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,v_1\}$ formed by some anchor $v_1$  (see
Lemma~\ref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}).  By
Lemma~\ref{tarski:pass-anchor}, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are anchors of
$\{v_0,v\}$. By Lemma~\ref{tarski:double-face}, $w_2,v_1$, and $w_1$
are consecutive anchors. If $v_1$ is a vertex of $Q$ we are done.
Otherwise, let $w_3\ne v_0,w_1,w_2$ be the remaining vertex of $Q$.
The edges $\op{conv}^0\{v,v_1\}$ and $\op{conv}^0\{v_1,0\}$ do not
meet
$\op{conv}\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ by Lemma~\ref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}.
Likewise, the edges $\op{conv}\{w_2,w_3\}$ and $\op{conv}\{w_3,w_1\}$ 
do not meet
 $\op{conv}\{v_0,v,v_1\}$. Thus, $v$ is enclosed over the
quarter $Q$.

Let $w_3'\ne w_1,v_1,w_2$ be a fourth anchor of $\{v_0,v\}$. By
Lemma~\ref{tarski:2t0-doesnt-pass-through}, we have $w_3'=w_3$.

\begin{proved}
We let $c_0$ be the point at distance $t$ from $v_0$ 
on the intersection of the
planes $\{v_0,v_1,w_1\}^\perp$ and $\{v_0,v_1,w_2\}^\perp$. 
consider the figure as a function of $y_4=|w_1-w_2|$. When $y_4$ is
sufficiently large the claim is certainly true.  Contract $y_4$ until
$c_0=c_0(y_4)$ meets the perpendicular bisector of $\{v_0,v_1\}$. Then $c_0$
is equidistant from $v_0,v_1,w_1$ and $w_2$ so it is the circumcenter of
$\{v_0,v_1,w_1,w_2\}$. It has distance $t$ from the origin, so the
circumradius is $t$. This implies that $y_4\le 2t$.

\begin{lemma}\tlabel{tarski:2CCrad}
Let $\{v_0,v_1,v_1'\}$ be a set of three points in $\ring{R}^3$.
Let  
$\mu = 3.2 - 1.255 = 1.945$.  Let $y = |v_1-v_0|$ and $y'=|v_1'-v_0|$.
Set $\psi = \arc(y,1.255,\mu)$.
Assume that $|v_1-v'_1|\ge 3.2$ and that $y,y'\le 2.51$.
Then 
   $$
   \op{rcone}(v_0,v_1,y/(2.51))\cap \op{rcone}(v_0,v_1',\cos\psi)
   =\emptyset .
   $$
\end{lemma}


\begin{proved}
Let $p$ be a point in the intersection.  Both sets are cones
that are symmetrical through the plane $A=\op{aff}(v_0,v_1,v_1')$.
Thus, the reflection $p'$ of $p$ through $A$ is also
in the intersection.  By the convexity of the two sets so is
the midpoint $(p+p')/2$.  Hence, we may assume without loss of
generality that $p\in A$.

Since both sets are cones,
we can scale $p$ to get another point in the intersection  
that belongs to the bisector of $\{v_0,v_1\}$.  We may
move along the bisector towards $\op{aff}(v_0,v_1')$ until
the boundary of $\op{rcone}(v_0,v_1,y/(2t))$ is reached.
Changing notation,
we assume that $p$ is this point on the bisector.
We then have $|p-v_1|=|p-v_0|=t$, $|p-v_0|< \mu$.
This violates the triangle inequality:
  $$
  3.2\le |v_1-v_1'| \le |v_1-p| + |p-v_1'| < t + \mu = 3.2.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proved}
Let $e_i = (v_i-v_0)/|v_i-v_0|$, for $i=1,2$. Let 
$e = e_1+e_2$.  By the first collinearity assumption, we have
$e\ne 0$.  Let $w_1,w_2$ be any two points such that
$(w_i-v_0)\cdot e = 0$ and $\{v_0,w_1,w_2\}$ are not collinear.

If 
 $$
 v_0 + t_1 (w_1-v_0) + t_2 (w_2-v_0)=v_0 + s_1 (v_1-v_0) + s_2 (v_2-v_0),

then taking the dot product of both sides with $e$, we get

  0 = (s_1 (w_1-v_0) + s_2 (w_2-v_0))\cdot e.

However, $(s_1 (w_1-v_0) + s_2 (w_2-v_0)$ and $e$ are both
