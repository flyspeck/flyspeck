The text_formalization/ directory contains Hol-light files for the formalization of
the text part of the Flyspeck project. It is structured along the lines of the .tex document "flypaper.tex" (Sphere Packings - a blueprint for formal proofs)

The subdirectory structure is as follows (in logical order)

The Multivariate/flyspeck.ml file is needed before any of the files in these directories.

X- general/  general definitions and tactics.
   This file contains crucial files giving the statement of the kepler conjecture.
   See general/audit_formal_proof.hl for a summary of files references in the 
   publication "A Formal Proof of the Kepler Conjecture"
   See general/the_kepler_conjecture.hl for the proved kepler conjecture.
   See general/the_main_stament.hl for the reduced form of the main statement that avoids
     the linear programming and nonlinear inequality parts of the proof.
X- nonlinear/  a list of nonlinear inequalities that are used in the text part of the proof
    See nonlinear/mk_all_ineq.hl for the code that generates the theorem
    |- the_nonlinear_inequalities
X- jordan/ some old material from the formal proof of the Jordan curve theorem.
X- leg/  lemmas in elementary geometry

Then the individual chapters follow.
1- trigonometry/  
2- volume/
3- hypermap/
4- fan/
5- packing/
6- local/
7- tame/ 

The files build.hl and strictbuild.hl go through the build sequence.
(The file strictbuild.hl goes through the build much more cautiously with greater
 error reporting.  The file build.hl does the ordinary everyday build.)

X- logs/ historical logs of changes and project issues.
